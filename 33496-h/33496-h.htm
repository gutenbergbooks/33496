<h2><a id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>The following narrative is put forth with all
the diffidence and apprehension that a mind
unaccustomed to literary pursuits, and limited
in its opportunities of improvement, naturally
feels on presenting itself for the first time to
the notice of the public. The doubts I entertain,
regarding the prudence of the step I have
taken, are in no small degree increased by the
circumstances under which the work has been
executed, the details having been entirely furnished
from memory, and without the aid of
any sort of data or memoranda. I should never
have dreamt of undertaking such a task, had
not the partiality of good natured, though perhaps
misjudging friends, overcame the scruples
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ii_">[Pg ii]</a></span>
which a consciousness of my own deficiencies
excited, and induced me to commit to paper
the scenes with which they professed themselves
to have been amused.</p>

<p>Having candidly admitted the demerits
of the work, I may now be allowed to say a
few words in its favour. Should it be taken up
in the expectation of supplying materials for
the defence of an erroneous policy, or the
gratification of party spleen, it will fall short of
the hopes of the reader, for I have endeavoured
to steer clear of every thing like political allusion
in the fear of adding to difficulties, which
already appeared sufficiently formidable, and of
wrecking my little bark on a stormy and
troubled sea. Mine is the simple, straightforward
narrative of a soldier, more accustomed to
wield the sword than the pen, and caring little
for the conflicting interests or animosities of
party. With such a small amount of profession,
it is not unreasonable to hope that the
public will extend towards it some portion of
that generous indulgence with which it is ever
wont to regard the literary efforts of the humbler
classes.</p>

<p>Towards the latter end of August 1838, rumours
reached Bombay and the various military
stations in the Deccan, that the troops were
about to be called into active service, and that
the scene of operations was to be at a distance
from our Indian territories. The extensive
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
preparations soon after set on foot, and the
unusual activity observable in the various
arsenals of the Presidency, left no doubt as to
the truth of these reports, and the only subject
of speculation that remained was, the precise
destination of the forces. Public curiosity was
at length set at rest, by the arrival of a proclamation
from the Governor General, directing
the assemblage of an army for service across
the Indus, and explaining at length the intentions
of Government. It will not be necessary
for the purposes of this narrative that I should
canvass the merits of this remarkable document,
or enter upon a discussion of the policy on
which it was founded. Sufficient is it for me
to say that the objects which it professed, were
the protection of our commerce, and the safety
of our Indian frontiers, both of which were
menaced by the intrigues and aggressions of
Persia. Having detailed the steps taken by
Dost Mahommed in furtherance of the views
of that power, and expressed its conviction,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
that as long as Cabul remained under his government
there was no hope that the interests of
our Indian empire would be preserved inviolate,
the proclamation proceeded to state, that pressing
necessity, as well as every consideration of
policy and justice, justified us in replacing on
the throne of Afghanistan, Shah <ins class="corr" title="Soojah-Ool-
Moolk">Sooja-ool-Moolk</ins>,
a monarch who, when in power, had
cordially acceded to the measures of joint resistance
to external aggression which were at
that time judged necessary by the British
government; and who on his empire being
usurped by its present rulers had found an
honorable asylum in the British dominions.
Such in a few words were the objects set forth
in Lord Auckland's proclamation and never
has unfortunate state paper been assailed with
such hostility and bitterness. Whether the
censures with which it has been visited are
deserved or not I will leave to others to
decide, contenting myself with the observation,
that failure and success are but too apt to sway
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
men's judgments and to give a character to the
circumstances that have led to them.</p>

<p>The Bombay troops ordered to form part of
the army of the Indus consisted of her Majesty's
2nd, or Queen's Royals, the 17th
regiment of Foot, 307 of her Majesty's 4th
Light Dragoons, the 1st regiment of Bombay
Light Cavalry, two troops of the Honorable
Company's Horse Artillery, one company of
Foot Artillery, the 19th regiment of Native
Infantry, the Poona Irregular Horse, with the
Sappers and Miners, the whole constituting an
effective force of about 6,000 men, under the
command of Lieutenant-General Sir John
Keane.</p>

<p>The 4th Light Dragoons were stationed at
Kirkee, about 70 miles from Bombay, when
orders arrived that the detachment should proceed
to the Presidency, for the purpose of
embarking for its destination. We left our
cantonments early in November, and overtook
the Artillery, which had preceded us from
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
Poona, at the Ghauts. We halted here two
days, and were joined by her Majesty's 17th
regiment of Foot, shortly after our arrival.
Short as was our stay, it was signalised by one
of those practical jokes which so often terminate
in fatal results, but which, unfortunately, seem
to have no effect in rendering people cautious.
Some artillerymen having been out shooting
game, one of them brought home a loaded gun
and carelessly left it in his tent. Several
of his comrades came in, in the afternoon, and
in the course of a carousal one of them took the
loaded piece, and presenting it at the nearest
soldier, jestingly threatened to shoot him. He
had scarcely uttered the word when the gun
went off and stretched his unfortunate comrade
dead at his feet. Nothing could equal the
distress and remorse of the homicide at the
thoughtless act by which he had deprived a
fellow creature of life, and it had a marked effect
on his future character and conduct.</p>

<p>The passage through the Ghauts is romantic
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
and picturesque in the extreme, the road lying
over stupendous mountains and through deep
ravines for the length of about seven or eight
miles. Some beautiful country houses have
been lately erected here by a wealthy Parsee
of Bombay, on sites which command the
finest and most extensive views in the
neighbourhood. These delightful summer retreats
are surrounded by every luxurious accessory
that wealth and taste can supply, and
the Governor is occasionally glad to fly to them
for a short respite from the cares of office.</p>

<p>We arrived at Bombay on the 15th of
November, and found it a scene of busy excitement.
The streets were filled with troops
and artillery proceeding to the place of embarkation,
and the inhabitants flocked in
thousands to the Bunder Head, to witness
their departure. The harbour was literally
alive with the numerous small craft employed
in conveying the troops to the different
transports, while the blue Peter flying at the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
mast head of the latter announced that we had
very little time for delay. We accordingly
hurried down to the beach, and were immediately
put on board the Cambridge. We
found it so crowded that Major Daly,
our commanding officer, was compelled
to remonstrate with the authorities on the subject,
and after some trouble, he succeeded in
getting from seventy to eighty men removed
to the other vessels. This did not sufficiently
lessen the inconvenience to prevent sickness
breaking out amongst us, and we lost one of
the Horse Artillery before we were many
days at sea.</p>

<p>The passage was short, but not unattended
with danger. The Cambridge struck on a
sand bank, off the Gulf of Cutch, and it was
with considerable difficulty that she was relieved
from her perilous position. We were
kept on the bank about four hours, and it may
easily be conceived that no small degree of
alarm and uneasiness prevailed amongst the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
landsmen, who were unaccustomed to dangers
of this description. The night was pitch dark,
and the breakers sounded unpleasantly near us.
Captain Douglass the commander of the vessel,
appeared however all confidence, and after trying
a variety of experiments to get her off, he
hit upon one which luckily proved successful.
The whole of the troops on board having been
ordered upon deck, the Captain directed them
to jump three times simultaneously. This was
done by our fellows with a hearty good will,
and had the instant effect of loosening the
vessel from the bank, and enabling her to float
again into deep water.</p>

<p>We arrived off the mouth of the Indus in
about fourteen days after our departure from
Bombay. The troops were immediately disembarked
in <i>pattemars</i>, small and clumsy coasting
vessels peculiar to the country. We
reached Bominacote the next evening without
any other accident than the sinking of three
boats, two containing artillery horses, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
other officers' supplies, to the value it was said
of £10,000 which had been sent on speculation
with the army by an eminent Parsee firm at
Bombay.</p>

<p>Bominacote forms a sort of harbour of refuge
for the vessels which carry on a trade along
this line of coast. The village itself consists
of a few filthy huts, and its inhabitants spend
their lives in hunting and fishing. Both males
and females are in a state of almost savage
nature little covering being used by them
beyond the loin <i>goity</i> or covering for the loins
common to the natives of these parts. The
proverbial vanity of the weaker sex was, however,
displayed in the eagerness with which
they bartered their most precious articles for a
few handkerchiefs of Manchester make that we
happened to have with us.</p>

<p>As soon as the horses belonging to the
cavalry, and the military stores had been landed,
it was decided that we should advance upon
Scinde in two divisions; the infantry under
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
the command of Brigadier Sir Thomas Wiltshire,
and the Cavalry under Brigadier Scott.
Previous to our departure the troops were reviewed
by Lieutenant-General Sir John Keane,
who had followed us from Bombay in the
Victoria steamer. Sir John expressed himself
in terms of warm satisfaction at the high state
of discipline and ardour of the men, who were
eager to be led against the enemy. The usual
precautions on entering hostile territories were
now taken, the Cavalry being ordered to
sharpen their sabres, and the Infantry served
with sixty rounds of ball cartridge.</p>

<p>Before we took our departure from Bominacote,
a melancholy circumstance occurred,
which threw a temporary gloom over us. As
the men were sitting down to dinner the report
of a pistol was heard in the officers' lines.
Suspecting some accident I ran to the spot,
accompanied by two of my comrades, and discovered
Lieutenant Fyers, one of the officers of
my own regiment, lying dead in his tent, with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
a freshly discharged pistol in his right hand.
The unfortunate gentleman had placed the
muzzle of it to his mouth, and the ball, taking
a slanting direction, had passed out over the
left ear. For several days previous he had
been observed to labour under great depression
of spirits, but no immediate cause could be
assigned for the fatal act. His loss was generally
lamented, for he was both a good officer
and an estimable member of society.</p>

<p>Our route lay through a country barren in
the extreme, scarcely a vestige of vegetation
being any where to be met with. Of the
natives we saw or heard nothing, for as we
advanced they fell back, deserting the villages
and betaking themselves to their mountain
fastnesses. It being now near Christmas the
men suffered some inconvenience from the
sudden transitions of temperature, the days
being sultry and the nights extremely cold.
The consequence was that the dysentery broke
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
out amongst us, and several fatal cases occurred.</p>

<p>At the close of the third days' march reports
became current through the camp that we
should soon see the enemy. It was said that
a force of ten thousand horse and foot was
about to take the field against us, and Captain
Outram was despatched towards Hyderabad,
to ascertain the truth of the story. He brought
back information that the enemy were ensconced
within the walls of that town, and
appeared to have little disposition to leave them.
We now began to find the difference between
quarters and camp, for the General thought it
necessary to send out frequent reconnoitering
parties and pickets, in order to guard against
surprise.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the fifth day, we
arrived at Tattah, a place of considerable antiquity,
and, I believe, mentioned in Holy
Writ. The Indus formerly washed the walls
of this town, but owing to some natural or
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
artificial ingredient the course of the river has
been completely changed, and it now runs at
about four miles distance.</p>

<p>Emerging from one of the most barren and
desolate tracts of country that it is possible to
imagine, even the tombs of Tattah, or City of
the Dead, as it is called in the language of the
natives, proved an agreeable distraction to us.
Tattah itself is a small, wretchedly built town,
containing little more than a thousand inhabitants,
who are for the most part of the Moslem
religion. The few Hindoos who reside here
constitute the wealthier part of the trading
community, but influential as this fact would
pre-suppose them, they are a persecuted and
oppressed race, the privilege of erecting places
of worship within the precincts of the town
being not only denied them, but even the free
exercise of their religious rites. Aggressions
of the most wanton and tyrannical nature, and
murders committed under circumstances of the
most shocking barbarity, and having their origin
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
solely in religious jealousy, are matters of no
unfrequent occurrence here.</p>

<p>The Hindoos are consequently obliged to
resort to the caves of the neighbouring mountains,
to practise their religious ceremonies, but
the relentless intolerance of their persecutors
pursues them even there. During our short
stay we saw the bodies of two of the proscribed
race, who had been found murdered in one of
their concealed temples.</p>

<p>The tombs of Tattah stand on a gentle
eminence, at a short distance from the town:
they are of circular construction, and are, as
nearly as I could judge, from seventy to eighty
feet in circumference, and from thirty to forty
feet in height. They are capped with domes,
but their external appearance presents nothing
graceful or ornamental to the eye. The interior
is gained by a staircase, which ascends to an
aperture forming the entrance, about midway
in the building, and a rudely constructed ladder
conducts the visitor downward to the basement,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
where the bodies lie. The interior of the dome
is lined with blue tiles richly ornamented with
arabesques and inscriptions from the Koran.
There are about a dozen of these remarkable
monuments and they are clustered together,
without arrangement or regard for effect. Of
the many sketches taken at the time I have not
seen one which conveys a correct idea of their
details. Although visited by nearly the whole
of the troops, it is a fact highly creditable to
their good taste and feeling that no mischief or
desecration of any sort was committed. Sir
John Keane, in a general order issued before
our departure, took occasion expressly to allude
to this circumstance, in terms alike honourable
to himself and to us.</p>

<p>A curious, and I must say revolting, instance
of the gross superstition of the Hindoos fell
under my observation whilst at Tattah. At
the northern extremity of the bazaar I was
shown some of the most miserable specimens of
humanity that can well be imagined. In a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
filthy mud hut, the very aspect of which
threatened contagion, sat two living skeletons
rocking themselves to and fro. They were without
covering of any sort, except the old blanket
on which they sat, and their deep sunk eyes
and contracted features told a tale of long but
patiently endured privation. I was informed
that these poor wretches were undergoing a
self-inflicted penance, for the non-performance
of some religious rite. They had condemned
themselves for a period of seven years to a
daily allowance of rice and water, barely sufficient
to prevent the extinction of the vital
powers. We offered them food, but they
sternly rejected it. This lamentable fanaticism
on the part of a simple and inoffensive people
is, after all, but another and more harmless
phase of the fierce bigotry, which still continues
to exist amongst European nations.</p>

<p>A <i>dâk</i>, or native postman, who had crossed
the river from Bhooj with letters for the camp,
was waylaid by two Belochees as he was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
descending towards it, by the left bank, and the
letter bag taken from him. His captors, having
brought him to their retreat in the hills, secured
his hands behind his back, and lay down to
sleep, one of them using the letter bag as a
pillow. The <i>dâk</i> remained quiet, until their
snoring satisfied him they were sound
asleep, and then slipping his hands out of the
ligatures, he stole over to the fellow who had
the post-bag under him, and placing his knee
on his breast, cut his throat from ear to ear
with a knife, which he took from the
mountaineer's person, and made off with the
bag. In about ten minutes after, he heard the
Belochee close upon his heels, and, redoubling
his speed, a chase of nearly ten miles ensued,
in the course of which, the poor fellow had
two or three times nearly yielded from fatigue.
The dreadful fate which awaited him, should
he fall into his pursuer's hands, flashed however
across his mind, and plucking up
fresh strength and courage, he at length succeeded
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
in reaching the camp, but in so weak
and exhausted a state that nature was near
sinking under the effort.</p>

<p>On the eve of our departure, a circumstance
occurred which created a very angry feeling
between the inhabitants and the troops, and
occasioned much regret to the Commander-in-Chief,
who was desirous that our advance should
not be marked by any thing which savoured of
cruelty. In consequence of the great increase
of drunkenness amongst the European troops,
owing to the cheapness and abundance of
liquor, strict orders were issued against its
being allowed into camp. One of the inhabitants
of Tattah, who was engaged in smuggling
the prohibited article, was stopped about dusk
by a serjeant, who happened to be going his
rounds. The fellow took to his heels, and a
sepoy, who was stationed as sentry in the staff
lines, mistaking him for a thief, and seeing him
pass at a speed which rendered capture out of
the question, levelled his musket, and shot him
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
dead on the spot. He was a fine muscular
fellow, about two or three and twenty, and
belonged to a respectable family in the town.
His friends immediately repaired to the scene
in a numerous body, and carried him off amidst
the wailing and lamentation of the women.
After this it was considered dangerous for any
of us to venture into the town when nightfall
had set in.</p>

<p>The army was now ordered to advance upon
Jurruk, a town situated on the banks of the
Indus, at about a day's march from Tattah. It
is better built and cleaner than the latter place,
and some of the streets are covered over with
thatched roofs, forming a series of rude arcades,
illuminated by oil lamps. Opthalmia is a
common disease amongst the natives, and several
of the troops were attacked by it. Some of us
also suffered severely from the guinea worm,
a malady, common in some parts of Hindostan,
and which, although not considered dangerous,
is attended with great pain. It generally
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
attacks the feet, and has the effect of effectually
crippling the patient for the time. I have had
one drawn out of my right foot, which measured
nearly half a yard in length, and I have known
others to have had no less than from seven
to eight of them at once. It being impossible
for persons thus affected to march on
foot or even to mount on horseback, they were
usually carried along with the army in kajarvees,
a sort of double-chair strung across the
back of a camel, and swinging with a see-saw
movement that occasioned no small additional
suffering to the unfortunate occupant.</p>

<p>The spot selected for the encampment was
extremely lovely, being encircled by hills, and
having the River Indus running on its right.
As the different regiments wound their way
round the heights, and descended into the plain
where the tents were to be pitched, the scene
would have made a beautiful subject for a
sketch. How often during a progress through
this wild and romantic country have I regretted
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
the want of a sufficient acquaintance with the
art of design, to enable me to convey to paper
some of its more striking and characteristic
features.</p>

<p>In consequence of the numerous thefts committed
by the Belochees, who daily carried off
numbers of our camels, it became necessary to
provide them with guards whilst at pasturage.
This, however, did not prevent the plunderers
from continuing their descents, and they became
so hardy that they sometimes even
ventured to attack or carry off the guards
themselves. One day, whilst a party of the
Poona Auxiliary Horse were in charge of some
camels about two miles from camp, the Belochees
came suddenly upon them. There
were only six of our men, whilst the enemy
numbered twelve or fifteen. Nothing daunted,
however, a gallant fellow dashed out from
amongst our men, and cut down three or four
of the marauders. Being quickly seconded by the
others, the Belochees took to flight, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
black hero dismounted, and cutting off the
head of one of his dead antagonists, strung it
by the hair to his crupper, and triumphantly rode
into camp with it, amidst the acclamations of
his comrades. A more substantial reward was
conferred upon him for this daring exploit a
few days afterwards by his promotion to the
rank of havildar or serjeant. This may be
said to have been the first occasion on which
any of our troops came into actual collision
with the enemy, but the example which was
made had little or no effect in restraining the
thefts of the Belochees who appeared to have
an incorrigible taste for this sort of adventure.</p>

<p>A melancholy incident occurred at Jurruk,
but whether it was occasioned by accident or
treachery we never could satisfactorily trace.
Some officers belonging to the Queen's Royals
applied for leave to go hunting in the preserves
of the Ameers of Scinde, and having obtained
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
it, Lieutenant Sparkes Lieutenant Nixon and
Dr. Hibbert, who constituted the party, left the
camp on foot at an early hour of the morning.
Their leave of absence expired at six o'clock
the same evening, but none of them had made
their appearance at that hour. About half
past eight a dog belonging to Dr. Hibbert was
observed returning into camp without his
master, which gave rise to gloomy apprehensions
amongst his brother officers, and the non
return of any of the party by next morning,
confirmed their worst fears. It was immediately
determined to send out a troop of native
cavalry to scour the country in search of them,
and the preserves were of course the first spot to
which they directed their horses. Part of the
force dismounted at the Shirkagh or Royal
Preserves, and proceeded on foot for a considerable
distance. Observing smoke ascending
in dense volumes to the right they made their
way towards it, and on gaining the spot a
shocking sight presented itself. A large area
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
had been cleared by the flames, and not a blade
of grass or brushwood had been left. The body
of Lieutenant Sparkes lay, dreadfully scorched
and mutilated, upon the ground, while that of
Dr. Hibbert was found in a tree, into which he
had evidently climbed to escape the devouring element.
A little further on lay Lieutenant<ins class="corr" title="period 
removed"></ins> Nixon
whose features were so withered and defaced,
that it was almost impossible to recognize him,
and from the contracted and distorted position
in which his limbs were found it was evident
that he had suffered a more agonizing death
than the others. The remains of the three
unfortunate officers were borne back to the
camp and interred with military honours.
They were all talented and spirited young men
and their untimely fate was a source of universal
regret and discussion. By some it was
contended that the natives had observed them
entering the preserves, and inspired by hate had
fired the woods in different places, so as effectually
to surround them and cut off all chance
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
of escape. To such a degree did this supposition
obtain credence, that the soldiers of the
Queen's Royals loudly demanded to be allowed
to take revenge on the inhabitants of the
district. This of course could not be permitted,
and the clamour that had been raised
about the matter soon died away.</p>

<p>Shortly after our arrival an order came down
from the Ameers of Scinde, that the inhabitants
of Jurruk should vacate the town and retreat
to Hyderabad. It was obeyed with great
reluctance, the love of home being stronger
with these poor people than their fear of the
British. Their removal was one of the most
distressing and painful scenes I have ever
witnessed, both men and women giving way
to wild bursts of passionate grief, and casting
back long and lingering regards at the habitations
they had abandoned. They left in bodies
of between two and three hundred, carrying
with them all their portable effects, and at
night the town was completely deserted. We
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
neither interfered with, nor molested them
during their preparations for departure, but
immediately on their quitting, a strong picket
was posted in some of the empty houses.</p>

<p>Provisions became extremely scarce in the
camp, and owing to the remissness of the Commissariat
in forwarding the stores from Tattah,
our grog was reduced from two drams
daily, to one dram on halting days. This was
attended with the worst possible effects, for it
encouraged the troops to search after the liquor
of the country; which proved not only injurious
to the constitution of the soldier, but to
the discipline of the service. Desertion became
of frequent occurrence, and from one hundred
to one hundred and fifty camel drivers from
India, together with some Ghorra Wallars, or
native horsekeepers, succeeded in making their
way across the river to Cutch Bhooj. A few
were caught, and from six to twelve dozen
lashes each were inflicted on the delinquents.</p>

<p>Captain Outram was again sent forward to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Hyderabad on a mission to the Ameers of
Scinde, but they received him in the haughtiest
manner and refused to come to any sort of
terms. The Captain found them fortifying the
hills round the city, under the superintendence
of an European officer, and he observed a
battery of twenty pieces of cannon, posted on
the banks of the river. Twenty thousand
Belochees armed with talwar, shield, and
matchlock, and two thirds of whom were dismounted,
occupied a position on the right bank,
so as to protect the battery. Half of this force
subsequently moved across the river and took
up a strong position on the western bank,
where we lay. The city was reported to be
full of armed men, and the idea of attacking it
previous to our junction with the Bengal army
was regarded as worse than folly, the river
being eighteen hundred feet wide and our pontoons
of insufficient length to traverse it. The
enemy, triumphing in our seeming inaction, sent
vaunting and threatening messages to us. The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
Commander-in-Chief took no notice of their
bravadoes, but silently made all the necessary
preparations for attacking the city as soon as he
was joined by the Bengal army. Strong
cavalry pickets were thrown out on the hills to
the right, which commanded an extensive view
of the surrounding country, and the sound of
drums and other military instruments was
strictly prohibited in camp.</p>

<p>On the 25th, Sir Henry Pottinger came into
camp from Hyderabad, the Ameers not only
refusing to pay the arrears of tribute that were
due, but treating the Envoy with every sort
of indignity. The Bengal army having come
through the Punjaub, and crossed the Indus at
Roree was now ready to act in conjunction
with us on the right bank of the river, and the
Commander-in-Chief resolved to lose no further
time in investing the city. He accordingly
commenced operations by planting a battery on
some heights which commanded its walls, but
which were at too great a distance for the guns
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
to do much damage. To the great disappointment
of both officers and men, who already
revelled in the anticipation of prize money,
the Ameers became alarmed at these demonstrations
and came to terms. An envoy, whose
appearance created no small amusement in the
camp, was despatched from Hyderabad to adjust
the necessary preliminaries. He was a short,
thick set old fellow, with a merry twinkling
eye, and as little as possible of what is called
official dignity about him. He brought with
him from twenty to thirty lacs of rupees, but
the reception which he met with from Sir John
Keane was not calculated to elevate the worthy
functionary in his own estimation.</p>

<p>Positive orders having been issued that
neither officers nor men should be allowed to
enter Hyderabad on any pretence whatsoever,
I am unable to give my readers a description
of the town. It appeared to be of considerable
extent, but of such little strength, that had
the Ameers driven matters to extremities, I
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
have no doubt we should have carried the place
in an hour.</p>

<p>We were exceedingly amused at the surprise
and consternation displayed by the inhabitants
of Hyderabad at the arrival of one of the iron
steamers in the Indus, with supplies for the
troops from Bombay. Nearly the whole of
the population flocked down to the banks of
the river to behold this surprising phenomenon;
they threw their arms in the air, and flung
themselves prostrate on the earth in perfect
ecstacies of wonder at every movement of the
mysterious power which propelled the vessel.
The scene was nearly as ridiculous as that
which greeted Columbus when the first notions
of European power and civilisation burst upon
the astonished minds of the simple aborigines
of America.</p>

<p>After remaining a few days at Hyderabad
the army resumed its march, and arrived next
evening at Baida. An accident occurred here,
by which a trooper of the 4th Light Dragoons
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
lost his life. The banks of the river were extremely
steep, and as we were watering our
horses the pressure from behind forced a man
named Helm into the river. He was instantly
carried away by the current, and was soon lost
to view, although we strained every effort to
save him. His body floated down to Hyderabad,
and was recovered by the natives, who
restored it to his commanding officer, together
with a belt full of rupees, which was found
round his waist.</p>

<p>Continuing our route we arrived at the
Lukkee Pass, where we found some thermal
springs, from which the sick derived considerable
benefit. A noble lake at the further
extremity of the defile afforded our officers
several days shooting and fishing, while the
beautiful scenery, by which it was surrounded
on every side, furnished such of them as were
artists with fine subjects for the exercise of
their pencil. Precipitous heights, assuming
every variety of fantastic form, stretched downward
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
to the water's edge, some in graceful
sweeps, and others in bold and threatening
attitudes, whilst their bases were hid in rich
woods or washed by the waters of the lake.</p>

<p>Leaving this romantic spot with regret, we
proceeded to Kotiah, where we lost two soldiers
belonging to her Majesty's 17th regiment of
Foot. They went out in search of some camels
which were at pasturage and were never afterwards
seen or heard of. A party which was
sent in search of them found the marks of footsteps
and some traces of blood on the spot
where the camels had been grazing, and from
the torn up appearance which the ground presented
there was little doubt that they had
made a desperate struggle for their lives.</p>

<p>Not satisfied with carrying off our camels, the
Belochees frequently ventured within the lines
after nightfall, and made off with any thing
they could lay their hands upon. Sir Keith
Jackson, the Captain of my own troop, detected
a fellow with a bridle in his hand, which he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
was watching an opportunity to slip off with
unperceived, and taking his hand whip he
inflicted a most unmerciful castigation upon
him. The rascal whined and moaned like a
corrected child during the progress of the
punishment, but as soon as he was let loose he
stuck his tongue in his cheek, and went laughing
out of camp.</p>

<p>Our next destination was Sehwan, a thickly
populated village, about seventy English miles
from Hyderabad. Here we were joined by the
ever to be lamented Sir Henry Fane, who was
to have assumed the command of the combined
forces at their junction at Candahar, but who
declined it in disgust at the wretchedly organised
state of the commissariat, and the neglect which
had been shown in providing for the contingencies
of the route. Sir Henry foresaw, and
subsequent events justified his views, that
although supplies might be regularly forwarded
from time to time, it was extremely doubtful,
nay almost next to impossible, that they could
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
reach an army always on the advance, through
distant and mountainous regions, and having
enemies hanging on its rear who were but too
deeply interested in preventing their safe
arrival.</p>

<p>Before Sir Henry left us he inspected the
troops, and appeared satisfied with the condition
of the men, who had not as yet encountered
hardships sufficient to affect their appearance.
There have been few men in command whose
personal qualities have more endeared him to
those who served under him than Sir Henry
Fane. He was between sixty and seventy
years of age, at the time I speak of, and his
venerable countenance, beaming with the
kindliest and most benevolent feelings, and
manners that had a parental touch about them,
combined to render him one of the most
respected and popular officers in the army.
We viewed his departure from amongst us with
the deepest regret, for though we felt the fullest
confidence in our then leader, this gallant
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
veteran had so won upon our affections that a
comparison with him must have proved invidious
to any one.</p>

<p>The ingenuity of the Asiatic jugglers is well
known, and I believe our European exhibitors
derive their proficiency, in a great measure,
from them, our soldiery carrying back with
them the rudiments of this respectable branch
of knowledge, and turning their swords, if not
into ploughshares, at least into as peaceable and
innocent a mode of gaining a livelihood. An
exhibition which took place during our short
stay at <ins class="corr" title="Schwan">Sehwan</ins> made many of the 
"greenhorns"
amongst us gape, and impressed them
with a very high notion of the favour in which
the professors of the art are held by his
Satanic Majesty. Returning one day from
the bazaar, I observed a crowd of soldiers and
natives assembled near the lines of the Artillery.
Elbowing my way through them I found a
conjuror at his tricks, and from the expensive
and elaborate nature of the paraphernalia by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
which he was surrounded, at once perceived
that his pretensions were of the highest order.
He was attired in loose flowing robes, covered
with mystic characters; and a long white beard
descended to his waist, contrasting oddly with his
jet black locks and piercing hazel eyes. Surrounded
by the various emblems and accessories
of his art, he looked a very imposing figure, and
every movement which he made was regarded
with as much interest as if destiny really rested
on his fiat. His only assistants were a man
who beat a <i>tom-tom</i>, or drum, to collect
an audience, and a beautifully formed girl
about five or six years of age, whose supple <ins class="corr" 
title="und">and</ins>
graceful movements excited general admiration.
Having made a clear space of about thirty feet
in diameter, the conjuror took an oblong basket,
about two feet in length, and one in breadth,
the interior of which he exhibited to the spectators,
in order to convince them that nothing
was concealed in it. After performing a variety
of common-place tricks, such as balancing a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
sword upon a pipe and then swallowing the blade,
he suddenly turned towards the child and addressed
her in an angry tone of voice. She made some
reply which appeared to make him still more
choleric, for his features became swollen with
rage, and his eyes shot glances of fire. The
discussion continuing in the same violent strain
he appeared no longer able to control his fury,
and suddenly seizing the child by the waist, he
opened the basket and crammed her into it.
The half stifled cries of the girl were distinctly
heard, but they only appeared to enrage him
the more. Snatching a sword, which lay near
him, he plunged it to the hilt in the basket,
twice or thrice, and every time he drew it out it
was reeking with gore. The half smothered
groans and sobs of the dying child at length
convinced several of the spectators that a
murder had been committed, and two or three
soldiers rushed into the circle for the purpose of
seizing the criminal. Triumphantly smiling at
the success of the cheat, he held them at bay
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
with the sword for a few minutes, when, to our
great surprise, the child bounded into the circle,
unscathed, from amidst the crowd, though we
had kept our eyes attentively fixed on the
basket all the time. Suspecting that two
children had been employed, I examined the
basket, but found no trace of an occupant, and
saw nothing in its construction which could
have aided the deception. This clever trick
was loudly applauded, and brought its author a
plentiful harvest of pice and cowries, while
many there were who went away with the firm
conviction that it could only have been effected
through the agency of the devil himself.</p>

<p>We had left a number of sick behind us at
Tattah, with instructions that they should be
conveyed in pattemars up the river Indus, and
rejoin us at Sehwan. A boat containing a
corporal and five men was stranded on the
banks of the river, and was with some difficulty
got off. The soldiers were so prostrated with
fever that they could scarcely move, and in this
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
state they arrived at Sehwan. To their great
distress they found that the army had proceeded
on its route, and one of their companions
expired immediately after their arrival. The
heat of the sun was intolerable, and the corpse
began to putrify. In vain they implored the
native boatmen to inter it or cast it in the river,
but they preferred running the risk of infection
to touching the dead body of an infidel. The
corporal, who was well acquainted with the language
of the country, entreated some of the
natives who crowded to the banks to remove
the body, but they remained deaf to his prayers.
Resorting to a stratagem which he thought
would have the effect of removing their religious
scruples, he asserted that the deceased had
died in the Mahommedan faith, and commanded
them on pain of the displeasure of the Prophet,
to give him decent interment. At first they
looked incredulous, but the corporal swore loud
and fast, and they were at length convinced.
They removed the body, and placing it on a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
sort of bier, somewhat similar to a sailor's hammock,
carried it on shore. Having swathed it
in cotton cloths, and laid it with the feet towards
the setting sun, they decked the head
and breast with flowers, and bore it in procession
to the place of interment, which was
situated in a romantic spot on the banks of
the Indus. The companions of the deceased
proceeded on their route, rejoicing in the success
of the corporal's trick, and rejoined the
main body without further accident.</p>

<p>Leaving Sehwan we crossed the Indus in pontoons,
and entered a fertile tract of country.
Our route lay through rich pasturage and
waving fields of corn, occasionally diversified
by rivers and lakes, the latter of which we
found well stocked with fish and game. The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
natives did not exhibit any symptoms of fear at
our approach, but continued peaceably tilling
and cultivating their lands. Proceeding by
rapid marches we at length reached Larkhana,
the boundary which divides Upper and Lower
Scinde. It is a place of considerable importance,
and contains from seven to eight thousand
inhabitants. Long cloths are manufactured
here in considerable quantities, and a brisk
trade is carried on, in various other articles with
the mountain tribes. Sir John Keane now quitted
us to proceed to Candahar, where he was
to assume the command of the Grand Army of
the Indus. He was accompanied by two
squadrons of Native Cavalry, one resselah of
Local Horse, a regiment of Native Infantry,
and two pieces of artillery. The command of
this division consequently devolved upon Major
General Wiltshire.</p>

<p>The Belochees again favoured us with a
visit and carried away about a dozen camels
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
from the encampment. A troop of cavalry was
ordered out in pursuit, and after a hot chase
succeeded in coming up with the marauders.
They immediately abandoned their prey and
made off to the hills, but not before they had
left three or four of their party in our hands.
Resolved to make an example which would
deter them from repeating the offence, General
Wiltshire ordered the cat to be liberally administered
to them in the Bazaar. The senior of
the party was first tied up, and it was evident,
from the trepidation he was in, that he expected
no less than the punishment of death. He
begged and implored for mercy, and finding
that no attention was paid to his supplications,
he took leave of one of the other culprits, who
turned out to be his son, and resigned himself
to die. Tied up, as he was, and unable to
observe the expression of our countenances,
which were convulsed with laughter, in anticipation
of the scene that was about to follow,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
he every moment expected to hear the report of
the musket, or feel the blow of the sabre that
was to deal out his doom. The moment, however,
the cat descended on his shoulders,
the terrified expression of his face changed into
that of the most extravagant joy. He smiled
and nodded at his son, and bore his four dozen
lashes with the joyful patience of a martyr,
suffering in the vindication of some holy
cause.</p>

<p>On being set loose the culprits were informed
that if they were ever again detected in the
commission of similar offences they would be
shot, without mercy, and they were ordered to
disseminate this useful piece of information
amongst their comrades of the hills.</p>

<p>Pursuing our route from Larkhana we encamped
the same evening at Dooson, and were
visited during the night by a terrific hurricane.
Arising without any previous indication, the
tempest came suddenly upon us in our sleep,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
sweeping the tents before it, and enveloping
us in whirlwinds of white sand. The night
being pitch dark we were soon in the greatest
distress and confusion, and to add to our embarrassments
the horses broke loose and ran
wild amongst us. They killed two of the
camp followers, and injured several others by
treading them under foot, and the alarm which
they created was as great as if the enemy had
made a sudden irruption amongst us. To this
succeeded a scene of rioting and squabbling, one
having lost a shaco, another a jacket, and another
his shoes. Accusations and denials, oaths,
vociferations, and complaints of injuries received,
formed altogether a pleasant medley;
and glad enough we were when the first streak
of dawn threw some light on this scene of horrible
confusion. After lasting about two
hours, heavy drops of rain announced the approaching
cessation of the tempest, but we
only exchanged one discomfort for another,
being soon drenched to the skin.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>After two days further march we arrived at
a wretched village, which separates Upper
Scinde from Belochistan, and which is only
entitled to notice as forming the boundary of
a desert plain, about fifty miles in extent, and
completely divested of vegetation, the white
soil lying exposed to, and reflecting back with
intensity, the scorching rays of the sun. There
were only two wells at the village, and there
was a fierce contest for precedence at them, it
being known that there was neither spring nor
stream of any kind in the desert which we
were about to traverse. The Infantry entered
on this cheerless waste about three in the
afternoon and the Cavalry followed about five.
The former were fully accoutred, and carried
sixty rounds of ball cartridge each. At two
o'clock the following morning the cavalry overtook
them and the general halt sounded. So
great was the fatigue of the infantry that
numbers threw themselves upon the ground
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
in despair, declaring, it was impossible for
human nature to sustain more, and they could
proceed no further. It must be borne in mind
that our rations had, for two months previous,
consisted of only half a pound of flour and an
equal quantity of red rice, with about four
ounces of meat, and the latter was in some
instances of no use to us, from the difficulty of
procuring fuel to cook it. The order of march
having been again given, several refused to
move from sheer exhaustion, and their situation
became one of great embarrassment to their
colonel, who was aware that if he left them
behind, they would be instantly sabred by
the enemy, who were always hovering on our
rear. Recollecting it was St. Patrick's Day,
and that most of the recusants were Irishmen,
he ordered, as a last resource, that the band of
the regiment should strike up their national
anthem. The effect was electrical, the poor
devils, whose limbs, a short time previous, had
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
refused to perform their accustomed office,
and whose countenances wore the aspect of
the most abject despondency, seemed at once
to have new life and energy infused into
them. They felt that this was an appeal to
their proverbial bravery and powers of endurance,
and gratified vanity did that which
threats and remonstrances had failed to
effect. A faint smile lit up their features, and
slowly rising from the ground they tottered
on their way. Had they adhered to their
first determination they would have fallen
victims to the most savage cruelties, as the
following circumstance will soon convince
the reader:&mdash;</p>

<p>Three of the cooks belonging to our division,
who followed with the camp kettles at a short
distance in its wake, lost their way in the darkness
of the night, and as chance would have it,
stumbled upon a party of the enemy. They
were immediately seized, and each man was
bound by the wrist to the saddle of a Belochee
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
horseman. The cries of the unfortunate men
having reached the rear-guard, which consisted
of the Native Auxiliary Horse, they turned
in pursuit, and soon came in sight of the
enemy, whose figures were dimly visible in the
obscurity which prevailed. As soon as they
heard them galloping up the Belochees spurred
their horses to their utmost speed, dragging
their prisoners along with them at a terrific
pace. Finding their pursuers gained upon
them they stooped down, and with their broad
knives ripped up two of their victims from the
abdomen to the throat, and then cast them
loose. The third, more fortunate, escaped with
life, the Belochee to whose saddle he was
attached having freed him by cutting off his
left arm with a blow of his sabre: then wheeling
round on our horse, who were now almost
up with them, the enemy took deliberate aim at
the advancing troopers, and having killed two,
and severely wounded another, they plunged into
the darkness and succeeded in baffling pursuit.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>We reached the extremity of this barren
waste by seven o'clock next morning, and encamped
at the bottom of a steep hill where there
was abundance of excellent water. The cupidity
of the inhabitants of the neighbouring
villages, having got the better of their apprehensions,
several of them ventured into the
camp with supplies of flour, which was
eagerly purchased from them by the soldiery,
at the rate of about half a crown the lb. The
risk which they ran was great, for if the
fact had been discovered, they would, in all
probability, have been massacred by the mountain
chief. The profits which they realised by
the adventure, must however, have well repaid
them for the hazard.</p>

<p>Descending the hills to our right, we
one day observed a funeral procession; and
curious to witness the ceremonies performed on
those occasions I followed at a little distance.
The corpse was swathed in cotton bandages like
a mummy, the head only being left exposed,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
and it was borne on a bamboo bier, or stretcher,
on the shoulders of four men. The relations
and friends of the deceased gave vent to their
grief in the bitterest lamentations, and there
appeared a depth and sincerity in their woe
which is but too often wanting at our European
rites. The procession was headed by a Faquir
or priest, whose rolling eyes, and long dishevelled
locks, gave him a wild and unearthly
appearance. His costume was no less singular
than his looks, for it consisted of a motley sort
of garment, composed of patches of almost
every colored cloth, with a cap or rather a
crown of peacock's feathers. Arrived at the
place of interment, which was situated in the
valley, the procession halted at a freshly dug
grave, and the bier was laid beside it. The
crowd formed themselves into a circle round it,
and the Faquir holding up a small idol, commenced
an oration in which he expatiated on
the merits of the deceased. The crowd having
prostrated themselves, the Faquir took a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
reddish sort of powder, and made a large mark
with it on the forehead of the dead man; then
taking a basket of freshly pulled flowers and
herbs he scattered them over the body and into
the grave. The mourners rising from the
ground, and walking in single files round the
bier made a respectful salaam towards it, after
which the corpse was lowered perpendicularly
into the earth, and the grave filled up. At the
conclusion, the Faquir sat himself on a stone
at a short distance from the grave, and remained
there quietly smoking his hookah, and
philosophising, as all good Faquirs should do,
on the uncertainty of mundane things.</p>

<p>Our next destination was Dadur, where we
were to form a junction with a portion of the
Bengal forces. The distance is only a day's
march, and nothing of interest occurred
on the route. On approaching the encampment
of the Bengal troops, I could not
help being struck with their superior appearance.
It was evident that their commissariat
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
was better organized than ours, for their camp
equipage and other appointments were in all
respects complete, and they were abundantly
supplied with necessaries of every kind. This
disparity was, in some degree, removed before
we left Dadur, by the arrival of additional
supplies from Bombay.</p>

<p>A few days having been passed in recruiting
our strength after these fatiguing marches, we
at length received orders to advance on the
celebrated Bholun Pass. Nothing could be
more calculated to awaken us to the difficulties
of our position, or to impress us with the uncertainty
of the fate that awaited us, than the
imposing grandeur of the scenery on which we
now entered. Let the reader picture to himself
a gloomy looking gorge winding through
two ranges of stupendous hills, whose rugged
masses of rock and hanging declivities impend
over the narrow route as if about to choke it
up, or recede a short distance to some fortress-like
looking freak of nature from whose imaginary
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
bastions and parapets it seemed easy to
hurl down destruction and death on the passenger,
and he may easily imagine that our
feelings were not of the liveliest or most comfortable
nature. A handful of men could have
effectually stopped our progress had there been
but another Leonidas amongst the wild inhabitants
of this magnificent defile, whose military skill
and resolution would have enabled him to seize
upon, and maintain its many points of defence.
We could not conceal from ourselves difficulties
so apparent, and a general and undefined feeling
of uneasiness pervaded us all. We felt that
if the enemy had any intention of resisting us
they would not lose opportunities which nature
herself appeared to indicate; and it was but
too obvious that if they only knew how to
avail themselves of the formidable barriers
which she had placed against invasion, our situation
would become critical in the extreme.
Once involved in the intricacies of the Pass, the
superior knowledge of the country possessed by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
the natives, and their familiarity with mountain
warfare would enable them to harrass us at every
step, and a well planned and daring attack
might at once overwhelm us. Such were the
reflections that suggested themselves to almost
every man's mind, and many there were, I dare
say, who just then thought of home, and speculated
whether it would ever be his lot to revisit its
peaceful fireside, and recount the dangers of
which he had been the hero.</p>

<p>The Bengal troops who preceded us through
the Pass left behind them sad proofs of the
justice of some of these conclusions. We
found from five and twenty to thirty camp
followers lying dead upon their track, the
throats of several having been cut, and the
others bearing on their mutilated persons the
unequivocal evidence of a desperate hand to
hand struggle. As we advanced through the
gorge we could observe the Belochees peering
at us over the jutting points of the precipices,
and the sharp report of their gingalls and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
matchlocks, which, luckily for us, were not
very sure in their aim, usually followed the
brief inspection by which we were favoured.
Observing a camp follower leading a camel at
some distance in the rear, three of the
mountaineers suddenly darted from a fissure
in the rock in which they had lain concealed,
and having cut the poor fellow down, led the
animal up the ascent by one of those diverging
tracks like sheep walks, with which these hills
abound. A serjeant belonging to the Horse
Artillery, who happened to witness the circumstance,
instantly galloped back, and gallantly
dashing his horse up the mountain succeeded in
sabreing the nearest of the thieves, and brought
back the camel amidst a shower of balls from
the neighbouring heights.</p>

<p>Within a few miles of the Affghanistan
boundary the gorge is traversed by a stream
which winds like a snake through the sinuosities
of the Pass, and crosses it no less than sixteen
times. Although it presents for the most part,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
the appearance of an insignificant mountain
rivulet, it is, in many places studded with
deep and dangerous holes, into which the
cavalry often plunged, and got a good sousing
before they were aware of it. Shouts of laughter
usually escaped the comrades of the luckless
wight who became thus involved, and on
one occasion a tragedy had nearly resulted from
their ill-timed merriment. An Irish trooper,
named Dwyer, a brave, but hot-blooded fellow,
like most of his <ins class="corr" title="couutrymen">countrymen</ins>, was 
feeling his
way cautiously through the stream, when both
horse and rider stumbled, and became instantly
lost to view. Some alarm was at first experienced
for their safety, but it gave way to a
roar of laughter when we beheld them again
emerging from the water. After several successive
attempts to disengage himself, the horse
at length obtained a secure footing, and Dwyer,
wheeling him suddenly round upon us with a
countenance furious with rage, drew a pistol
from his holster and fired at a group of seven or
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
eight men, who stood close to the spot, but fortunately
without effect. The madman was immediately
placed under arrest, but was released
after a few days' confinement.</p>

<p>On approaching Beebenaunce towards the
close of the fourth day's march, we found
another stream where the Cavalry dismounted,
for the purpose of filling their canteens with
water, while the Infantry were distributed so
as to protect them. We had been marching for
several hours under a scorching sun, and over a
stony and rugged road, which rendered constant
watchfulness and exertion necessary to prevent
the horses from falling on their knees. Tormented
by an insatiable thirst, we were about
to slake it, when it was discovered that the
stream was polluted by the putrifying bodies
of several of dead Affghans, and followers of
the Bengal Army; the spot having been the
scene of a deadly contest which had occurred
some days previous. The struggle between
the loathing which this circumstance created
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
and the pressing calls of nature was however of
short duration. Not a man of us hesitated to
drink from the contaminated liquid, but the
horse which I rode, being imbued with keener
senses than his master, positively refused to
partake of it, though almost dropping with
fatigue and thirst. I took him lower down
the stream, where his fastidiousness being no
longer offended he indulged in a long and
copious draught.</p>

<p>We were about to quit the Pass at the close of
the eighth day's march, when the enemy made
another and more successful attempt at plunder.
Emboldened by the absence of the Infantry,
which was at a considerable distance in the
rear, they descended the heights in greater
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
numbers than usual, and attacked the camp
followers in charge of the officers' baggage.
The latter took to flight, and the Belochees
commenced pillaging the trunks and cases.
Amongst the property carried off was a camel
belonging to Brigadier Scott, which was laden
with the whole of the general's kit. A party
of the 4th Dragoons, under the command of
Lieutenant Gillespie, at length galloped up
and put the enemy to flight. There were only
three men wounded and three horses killed on
our side, whilst the Belochees left great numbers
of dead on the ground.</p>

<p>During the heat of the firing a mistake occurred,
which at first occasioned some alarm,
but was soon converted into a burst of uncontrollable
merriment. Our men had driven the
last of the enemy up the hill, the latter peppering
away at them from every rock or crevice
where they could find shelter, when our attention
was arrested by the appearance of a general
officer on the heights to our left, who appeared
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
to be making signs to us. It was at first supposed
that one of our leaders had fallen into
the hands of the enemy, and universal consternation
prevailed. The General at length took
off his shaco, and advancing to the very
edge of the precipice, waved it in the air as if
to cheer us on to his rescue, when to our
infinite amusement we discovered it was the
fellow who had made off with the Brigadier's
kit, and who, after examining the contents of
it, had rigged himself out in full uniform. The
rocks echoed with laughter, and the <i>pseudo</i>
general appeared to enjoy the fun as much as
any of us, for he capered about in a perfect
ecstacy of delight, and gave expression to his contentment
in the most delectable yells. A shower
of balls was at length directed against him, and
the Brigadier's swarthy representative came
tumbling down the precipice to render himself
and his briefly enjoyed honours into our hands.</p>

<p>Amongst the booty carried off upon this
occasion were the wind instruments belonging
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
to the 1st Bombay Cavalry, and a bullock, carrying
two packages of ball ammunition, which
contained 500 rounds each. Some amusement
was created amongst us by speculations as to
the probable use that would be made of the
former, the humour displayed in the appropriation
of General Scott's kit having given us a
high idea of the waggish propensities of
the enemy. Our fun was however turned into
mortification when we beheld them cutting our
ball ammunition into slugs to fit the bore of
their gingalls, and sending it back to us from
the heights in as wholesale quantities as they
had taken it.</p>

<p>In the course of the skirmish a feat was performed
by two of the native troops, which was
watched with the most intense interest. A
Bruhee (a fierce and warlike tribe, distinguished
by their inveterate hostility towards the black
troops in our service,) had taken shelter behind
a rock, about midway up the mountain, and
kept up a constant fire on some native cavalry
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
beneath. Two of the Sepoys belonging to the
Bombay Native Infantry observing the circumstance,
determined on effecting his capture,
and laying down their muskets at the foot of
the hill, they crept stealthily up. Whenever
the fellow's flashing eyes were observed on a
line with the rock, searching for an object for
his aim, they crouched under cover until the
discharge of his gingall satisfied them he
was about to reload. They then rapidly advanced
to his lurking place, and pouncing
suddenly upon him conveyed him down the
hill. The prisoner had such a horror of falling
into our hands that he several times implored
his captors to put an end to him on the spot.
They took no notice of his entreaties until they
had reached the bottom of the hill, where they
had laid their arms, when a havildar meeting
them inquired if they had not heard of the
orders, that no prisoners should be brought
into camp. "I knew nothing about it," replied
one of the soldiers; "but this I do know
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
that he is a stout-hearted fellow, and deserves
a better fate." "<i>I</i> understand you," exclaimed
the other Sepoy, and taking his musket he
placed the muzzle of it to the prisoner's head,
and literally covered the serjeant with his
brains.</p>

<p>The quantity of carrion which we every
where left upon our route attracted numbers
of the ravening beasts of prey with
which these hills abound, and we could not rest
at night from the dismal howling which surrounded
us. Even the new made graves of our
comrades did not escape the keen and hungering
scent of the jackall, their remains being
scarcely interred before we found them again
torn up, their whitening bones alone attesting
the nature of the visitation. Amongst the
greatest of our annoyances, however, was the
intolerable stench which proceeded from the
putrefying bodies of the camels, that lay
scattered every where upon our track, and
which was enough to breed a mortality.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>As we emerged from the Pass into the open
country, the heights became literally alive with
Belochees, who gave expression to their rage
and disappointment in the most absurd and
violent gesticulations. We bivouacked late at
night in the open plain, after a fatiguing and
harassing march of twelve hours, during which
we had been unable to procure a drop of water.
The same privation awaited us in the place
where we passed the night, and the sufferings
of both men and cattle were dreadful. It was
not until six o'clock next day that we fell in
with a stream that traversed the road to Quettah,
and were able to satisfy the thirst which consumed
us. We were now in the valley of
Shawle, which presented a most agreeable contrast
to the barren hills through which we had
just passed: here we found a succession of vast
orchards, whose fruit trees bursting into blossom
and gladdening the wearied eye with a variety
of the most beautiful tints recalled to most of
us the pleasant scenery of dear old England.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>On our arrival at Quettah the troops underwent
a medical inspection, and it was determined
that the sick should be left behind. A depôt
was accordingly established here, consisting of
one regiment of Bengal Infantry, one company
of European Foot Artillery, some heavy
ordnance, and some Gikwar, or native horsemen,
the whole under the command of
Brigadier-General Nott. This arrangement
was reported to have given rise to some angry
altercation between the latter officer and Sir
John Keane previous to the departure of the
Commander-in-Chief for Candahar, General
Nott being indignant at being thus invalided
and debarred his share in the danger and glories
of the campaign. We remained at Quettah
about a week, the condition of both men and
horses being such as to render rest necessary.
The supplies which we obtained from the Bengal
column and the rich pasturage of the
surrounding country soon refreshed and re-invigorated
us, and we pursued our route in
renewed health and spirits.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>Leaving Quettah, we again entered a barren
and mountainous district which presented few
traces of cultivation, and which afforded little or
no pasturage for our cattle. In order to embarrass
us the more the Belochees lay on the watch
for the parties who were sent out to cut grass,
and maimed and mutilated them in the most
shocking manner. One poor fellow had his ears
slit, and another received injuries which rendered
the amputation of an arm necessary. The
thefts of cattle, however, became less numerous,
the cutting off the supplies of forage being
deemed a less hazardous and equally effectual
mode of impeding our progress.</p>

<p>So serious became this change in the tactics
of the enemy that it was resolved to increase
the number of men sent out on the foraging
expeditions. This did not, however, deter the
Belochees from repeating their attacks, and on
one occasion they drove in a party consisting
of a considerable number of native soldiers, and
succeeded in making three or four of the grass-cutters
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
prisoners. A squadron of her Majesty's
4th Light Dragoons was immediately ordered
out in pursuit under the command of Major
Daly. We proceeded towards the hills at full
gallop, and at length came in sight of the enemy
who were in a close body of from three to four
hundred. They suddenly disappeared from
view, although the country was still a perfect
level, and presented no apparent means of concealment.
On reaching the spot we found
they had ensconced themselves in a large stone
pit or quarry, into which it was impossible for
cavalry to penetrate, and a sharp and well
directed fire from all the salient points of the
rocks affording the least shelter, indicated to us
their different lurking places. Patiently watching
our opportunities we sent a volley into
every recess or cavity where a rag was to be
seen fluttering, and Major Daly observing a
party of about ten or twelve clustered in some
bushes which lay almost within a bound of his
horse gallantly dashed the animal down the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
descent, followed by Lieutenant Janvrin,
the quarter-master of the regiment, and with a
couple of hog spears, which they happened to
have with them they dispatched several of the
party. The others made their escape by
plunging deeper into the recesses of the
quarry.</p>

<p>The night now setting in, the Belochees
took advantage of the obscurity to steal out of
their lair and creep through our lines one by
one. They did not get off, however, without
further loss. Hearing a rustling noise within a
few feet of me, whilst on the watch, I listened
attentively and felt convinced that some of
them were endeavouring to effect their escape
by crawling along the ground on their hands
and knees. I plunged my spurs in my horse
and clearing the distance at a bound, just as I
observed two men rising from the ground,
I cut them both down, notwithstanding a most
determined resistance, in the course of which
they fired twice at me. Several others were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
disposed of in like manner, but no prisoners
were made. We returned to camp about nine
o'clock, well satisfied with the issue of our adventure.</p>

<p>The grass cutters who had been made
prisoners, and who were abandoned when it was
found that our pursuit was likely to prove
successful, had received no other injury at the
hands of the enemy, than a severe thrashing with
a bamboo. The poor fellows were terribly frightened,
and felt most grateful for their deliverance.</p>

<p>Major Daly and two privates were severely
wounded in this affair. Beside a thrust of a
sabre in the chest the Major received a musket
ball in the left foot, which disabled him for
some time from active service. We also found
that several of the horses had been injured, it
being a favourite trick of the enemy to hamstring
them, or rip their bellies open, whenever
they could get within reach of the animals.</p>

<p>A treacherous trick played us by one of the
neighbouring chiefs, the Khan of Khelat, added
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
in no small degree to the difficulties we had to
encounter. The Khan had promised allegiance
to Shah Soojah, and undertook to facilitate the
progress of the British troops through his
territories. Instead of fulfilling the friendly
professions he had made towards us, he interdicted
the villagers from bringing supplies
to the camp, and cut off almost all the mountain
streams. Several of the camp followers who
ventured out in search of water, were either
carried off or murdered, and our situation
became distressing in the extreme. In one
day's march of fifteen miles, we left upon our
track the bodies of nearly one hundred men,
who died from sheer physical exhaustion.</p>

<p>Continuing our progress towards the Khojuck
heights, where we expected to meet with determined
opposition, we lost a number of men on the
route from their own imprudence in venturing
at a distance from the camp after dusk. One
of them, a Portuguese cook, belonging to my
own regiment, lost his way in proceeding to the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
bazaar for necessaries, and fell into the hands
of the Belochees, who were always hanging on
our rear. His cries being heard by some
soldiers returning from the bazaar, they ran
towards the spot from whence the noise proceeded,
and were received with a volley of
bullets. They did not of course venture farther,
being ignorant of the number of the enemy,
but on procuring assistance from the camp,
they discovered the cook with his throat
cut, the head being nearly severed from the
shoulders.</p>

<p>Sickness now increased alarmingly amongst
us, owing to the bad quality of the attar or
flour, as well as the reduction in our usual
quantity of rations. The cattle were little
better off, and the difficulties of the route increased
at almost every step. Water continued
as scarce as ever, for the natives filled up or
concealed part of the wells and poisoned the
remainder. Of the latter fact, we received
intimation in time to prevent accidents, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
chance befriended us as regarded the former.
After a harassing day's march some soldiers of
the 17th Infantry, who had set out in search
of water, were unsuccessful and were bewailing
their hard fate, when the unusual moistness
of the place where they had pitched their tent
attracted their notice. They sounded the
ground and finding it hollow, immediately
arrived at the conclusion that it was a well that
had been freshly covered over. Further examination
confirmed this supposition, and about
half an hour's work revealed a deep hole to
their sight, in which they found a spring of
excellent water. This discovery created such
joy and frantic eagerness in the camp that the
authorities were obliged to place a strong guard
with loaded muskets over it in order to keep
back the pressure of the crowds who flocked
to it.</p>

<p>In the course of the next day's march we
came upon a part of the road which was literally
strewn with human skeletons and broken
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
matchlocks. Of the various surmises current
amongst us as to the occasion of this wholesale
butchery, the most probable was, that one of
the caravans travelling to Candahar had been
attacked and overpowered by one of the marauding
tribes of the district.</p>

<p>We reached the Khojuck Pass in the expectation
of finding it occupied by the forces of Dost
Mahommed, but contrary to general anticipation
it was abandoned. We learned that the Dost
had visited the place a few days before, in company
with several of his chiefs, when the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
prudence of disputing our passage was discussed.
Owing to some violent differences of
opinion amongst the subordinate chiefs, the
idea was abandoned, and the enemy fell back
towards Candahar. How different might have
been the fate of the expedition but for this
impolitic and cowardly step. To enable the
reader to judge of its importance a brief description
of the Pass will be necessary.</p>

<p>Ascending an eminence of no great height
a platform of rock is gained, from which a
glorious view bursts upon the sight. Immediately
beneath is a steep declivity, along whose
rugged sides winds the narrow road, while a
chasm of immense depth yawns beneath, and
threatens to engulph the luckless passenger
should he chance to slip as he treads his way
down the difficult and dangerous descent.
Receding into the far distance lie long ranges
of blue mountains broken at intervals into open
plains and valleys, whose calm and smiling
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
aspect contrasts well with the frowning majesty
of the neighbouring heights.</p>

<p>Nothing could be finer than the view which
presented itself as our troops wound round the
brow of this tremendous precipice, their arms
glittering in the sun, and their uniforms imparting
a gay and dazzling variety to the sober
hues of the stunted herbage with which its sides
were clad. The Infantry, consisting of several
companies of the Queen's Royals and a party
of the 17th regiment were ordered to line the
heights in order to protect the descent of the
Artillery and Cavalry, together with the heavy
baggage. So steep was the road (if road it
could be called) that the Cavalry were obliged
to dismount and lead their horses, bridle in
hand, and the Artillery to unlimber their guns
and drag them down the precipice, a task, as
the reader may conceive, of no small labour and
difficulty. About half way down, a camel,
laden with camp equipage, missed its footing
and was precipitated into the abyss with its
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
conductor, and both were of course, immediately
dashed to pieces. We reached the plain
without any further mishap about six o'clock the
same evening, and had every reason to congratulate
ourselves that the cowardice or
negligence of the enemy had prevented them
from disputing our passage.</p>

<p>Having halted at the bottom of the Pass
two days so as to enable the remainder of the
heavy ordnance and baggage to descend we
proceeded towards Candahar. The enemy
occasionally made their appearance, and though
not caring to face us in the field, continued to
harass us severely by hanging on our rear, and
cutting off the stragglers. Nor did they abate in
the least in their love of thieving, robberies
being just as frequent, and characterised by as
much ingenuity and daring as ever. Late
one night I was on sentry before the tent of
Lieutenant Kemp when a rustling noise attracted
my notice; on looking attentively
towards the spot from whence it proceeded, I
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
perceived an Affghan crawling towards the tent
on his hands and knees, and suffering him to
enter, in order the more easily to secure him, I
surprised him as he was in the act of plundering
it. The fellow was completely naked, and
on my attempting to lay hold of him he slipped
through my fingers like an eel, owing to the
quantity of grease with which his person was
smeared, and succeeded in clearing the lines in
safety. I did not shoot him because positive
orders had been issued against shots being fired
in camp, which had before given rise to many
groundless alarms.</p>

<p>The weather now became excessively hot,
the thermometer being 125 degrees in the
shade, which rendered it necessary that we
should prosecute our way either in the
cool of the morning or at night. The nights
were so beautiful that the latter could not be
deemed a hardship, and had the scenery been
but equal to that through which we had just
passed, it could not have been seen to greater
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
advantage than under these clear delicious
moonlights. Nothing, however, can be more
flat or uninteresting than the country between
the Khojuck Pass and Candahar. The only
thing that might be said to have broken the
monotony of the route was an occasional shot
which told the fate of some poor horse, who,
having been broken down by fatigue and privation,
and rendered incapable of further exertion,
was mercifully put out of pain by its
rider. There were nearly fifty head of cattle
disposed of in this way between the Pass and
Candahar, a pretty item in the expenses of the
campaign, when it is borne in mind that each
of them had cost from fifty to sixty pounds in
India. Had we come in contact with the
enemy at Candahar as we expected, I have no
doubt the Cavalry would have been found
wholly ineffective from the jaded and worn-out
condition of their horses.</p>

<p>We arrived at Candahar on the 4th. of May,
and effected a junction with the remainder of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
the Bengal forces under Sir Willoughby
Cotton. Here we were also joined by Shah
Soojah in company with Sir William McNaghten
and Sir Alexander Burnes. The
dethroned monarch immediately took possession
of his ancestral palace, which had just been
evacuated by the enemy. The reverses of
fortune to which these Asiatic sovereigns are
subject have so steeled them against adversity,
that I doubt if his Majesty was agitated, even
by a passing emotion, at this important event.
If he felt at all, it was perhaps more a sensation
of fear than joy, for he could not conceal from
himself the fact, that the opinions of his subjects
were arraigned to a man against him, and
that under such circumstances his tenure of
sovereignty would in all probability be terminated
by a bloody death.</p>

<p>Tired as we were of the harassing mountain
warfare in which we had been engaged, and
anxious to strike a blow which would decide
the fate of the Campaign, we were yet agreeably
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
disappointed at the evacuation of Candahar
by the enemy. We were greatly in need of
rest after the long and fatiguing marches,
which we had made; and the deplorable condition
in which we found ourselves, as regarded supplies,
rendered it highly impolitic to bring us
just then in face of the enemy. Sickness had
increased alarmingly amongst us, but in this
respect we did not find our position improved, for
the excessive heat which prevailed during our
stay here carried off great numbers of the
men.</p>

<p>Although the bazaar was plentifully supplied
with meat and fruit, flour was difficult
to be obtained, the stock on hand having
been eagerly bought up by the troops on their
arrival. The traders turned the scarcity of this
necessary article to profitable account, for they
only gave 2℔. to the rupee instead of 40℔.,
the usual proportion. We had been living on
half rations, and these not of the best quality,
for nearly a month previous, and had looked
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
forward to our arrival at Candahar for some
addition to the quantity, but so far was this
from being the case, that it was found necessary
to put the camp followers on the same allowance,
and it was not until three weeks after our
arrival that an increase and that not the full
one, was served out to us.</p>

<p>We were in daily expectation of the arrival
of a convoy of six hundred camels laden with
provisions and grain, but intelligence having
been brought us that the Affghans lay in way
to intercept it, it was thought advisable to send
out a force consisting of two squadrons of
native cavalry, a party of her Majesty's 13th
Light Infantry and two field pieces for its
protection. The enemy being informed by
their spies of this movement, fell back to the
hills, and the supplies were brought in safety to
the camp. The native contractor who furnished
them, was offered a bribe of 10,000 rupees by
Dost Mahommed to direct his camels another
way, but much to his credit refused it.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>Candahar is a place of considerable importance
in a commercial point of view, but its
military advantages are scarcely deserving of
notice. It is surrounded by an old wall and
ditch, some efforts to strengthen which had
been made by throwing up a few parapets, but
they were abandoned at the first news of our
approach. The principal entrance faces the
south and leads directly into the bazaar, which
presents rather an animated scene to the eyes
of the stranger, in consequence of the varied
and picturesque costumes of the multitudes
who resort to it, and who are composed of
Asiatics of almost every race. The merchandize
exposed for sale is no less heterogeneous
in its character than its vendors, and much to
our surprise and gratification it included good
broad-cloths and Whitechapel needles, articles
which, in the dilapidated and transparent
state of our clothing, proved of no small service
to us.</p>

<p>Common and disgusting as mendicancy has
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
become through all parts of Asia, I have never
seen it carried to such an annoying extent as
here. Our ears were assailed on all sides by
whining petitions, and our eyes offended by
the exhibition of festering sores or simulated
deformities. The ingenuity displayed in twisting
a straight and well made limb into some
hideous distortion, or in painting up an ugly
case of cancer, would have excited the admiration
and envy of the importunate cripples who
beset the chapels of Catholic countries.</p>

<p>At the further extremity of the bazaar
stands a noble mosque, in which are interred
the remains of Shah Soojah's father and grandfather.
A lofty gilt dome and graceful minarets
distinguish it above the other buildings of
the town, and the effect, as it is approached
from the distance, is extremely imposing. On
entering this beautiful temple the visitor is
conducted up a flight of marble steps to a
platform within the dome, where the remains
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
of the deceased princes lie. The tombs are
covered with palls of blue velvet, fringed with
gold, and illuminated by about two hundred
lamps, which are kept burning night and day,
while forty Faquirs, or priests, watch perpetually
over them. Two magnificent folio
editions of the Koran, bound in velvet and
ornamented with characters of gold, were also
shown to us with a degree of reverence that
proved the estimation in which they were held.
A few pigeons which were flying round the
interior of the building appeared to divide with
these costly exemplars of the Book of Life
the regard and veneration of the votaries of
the temple, this bird being held sacred, and
any invasion of its privileges visited by the
punishment of death.</p>

<p>Several of the Affghan Chiefs who were
known to be devoted to the interests of Dost
Mahommed becoming alarmed at the turn
affairs were taking, or, as some said, being dissatisfied
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
with that prince for refusing to guarantee
the safety of their women, now came
into camp and tendered their allegiance to
Shah Soojah. These reluctant auxiliaries were
warmly received by the Politicals, who hailed
their adhesion as an omen of the success of the
expedition; and I observed Sir Alexander
Burnes carry his joy so far as cordially to embrace
one of them. The Chief smiled grimly,
but said but little. I had an opportunity however
of ascertaining his real feelings, on getting
amongst his followers a few days afterwards.
They openly expressed their regret at
being compelled to join the invaders of their
country, and stated, that they could not have
a braver leader, or a better prince, than Dost
Mahommed. They described him as being of
a just and generous nature, whilst they
represented the Shah as being cruel and unprincipled.</p>

<p>These Affghan horsemen were a fine athletic
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
set of men, and capitally mounted, their
breed of cattle being much superior to ours,
and exhibiting proofs of the most careful
grooming. The riders wore coats of mail with
steel gauntlets, and their arms consisted of a
sabre, heavier and longer than ours, a dagger,
and in some instances shields and matchlocks.
I have no hesitation in saying that the Affghan
Cavalry, if these were a fair sample of
them, are a most effective body of men. They
may not be equal to ours in the field, but for
a harassing system of mountain warfare where
they are required to make sudden descents
upon Infantry, hemmed in between defiles, and
embarrassed by ignorance of the country, no
body of troops can be better adapted. Their
horses are light limbed, but strong and wiry,
and capable of undergoing incredible fatigue
while the trooper himself, practised from infancy
in the management of the animal, can
ride him over places where no European horseman
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
would venture. Had these wild mountaineers
but the advantages of discipline and
proper organization their country would be
inaccessible to any troops in the world.</p>

<p>In order to give a sort of political eclat to the
steps taken to reinstate Shah Soojah on the
throne of his ancestors, it was resolved that he
should be solemnly inaugurated at Candahar,
and nothing was omitted that could possibly
tend to render the ceremony imposing. On
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
the morning fixed for its celebration, the whole
of the British forces were paraded in review
order on a large plain to the north of the city,
whilst the Shah's troops were drawn up at a
little distance. In the centre of the field stood
a platform canopied with crimson silk, and
ornamented with numerous banners and devices,
the seat reserved for the Shah being ascended
by a broad flight of tapestried steps, and covered
with cushions of crimson and gold. The other
accessories of the pageant were got up in similar
costly style, but the effect, on the whole, conveyed
to the mind rather the unsatisfied feeling
which attends the hollow show and glitter of
the theatre, than the idea of substantial power.
The weather was beautiful, the sun shedding its
gorgeous rays full upon us, and finding innumerable
reflections in the military panoply
beneath. The heat was however excessive, and
the majority of us would have willingly exchanged
our places in the ceremonial for the
shade and repose of our tents.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>As early as six o'clock the Commander-in-Chief
took up his position in front of the line,
and was received with a general salute. The
Shah was soon after observed leaving the gates
of the city on an elephant, the howdah of which
was of solid silver. His Majesty appeared to
me to be between fifty and sixty years of age;
of middle stature, and somewhat inclined to
corpulency. His features were large, but regular,
and the expression which played about
them was not calculated to leave a favourable
impression on the physiognomist. It had a
mingled character of vaccillation and cruelty
about it, which impressed one with the notion
that the possessor could sink with ease from
the extreme of tyrannical self-will to the
abject and fawning humility of the slave.
His Majesty was accompanied by his Vizier,
a tall, spare looking man of a thoughtful and
rather melancholy cast of features, and somewhat
older than his master. Immediately behind
the Shah rode Sir William McNaghten,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
in full court dress, such as is usually worn by
officials at her Majesty's levees in England,
and he was followed by Sir Alexander Burnes,
in a plain suit, and surrounded by the Affghan
chiefs, with whom he appeared to be in close
and friendly converse. The winning smile and
frank and courteous manner of the latter gentleman
appeared to have gained for him a degree
of consideration amongst the natives, which no
other European could boast of, and which was
principally attributable to the talismanic influence
of qualities that have a never failing
effect in softening down and subduing even the
most rugged and intractable natures. Nothing
could exceed the splendour of the costumes in
which these chiefs were clad, their turbans and
weapons being studded with diamonds and
other precious stones; whilst the horses on
which they were mounted were perfect models
of animal beauty.</p>

<p>As soon as the Shah arrived on the ground
the bands of the different regiments struck up
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
"God save the King," and his Majesty was
conducted to his throne by the Politicals. The
troops then marched past the platform in slow
and quick time each regiment lowering its
colors as it arrived before it. A proclamation
was afterwards read, declaring and confirming the
Shah's title to the throne, and all persons subject
to his authority having been required to
yield him fealty, the Affghan Chiefs present
tendered their homage. The troops were
marched back to their lines immediately after,
and a Durbar concluded the ceremonies of the
day.</p>

<p>It must not be imagined that during all this
time our ever watchful enemies had abated
their vigilance or lost any opportunity of annoying
us. They did not dare to attack the
camp, itself, precautionary measures having
been adopted to prevent their near approach,
by stationing inlying and outlying pickets
round it. We were compelled, however, to
send our camels to graze at some distance from
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
the encampment, and the soldiers in charge of
them were frequently surprised and driven in.
On one occasion a party of the 13th Light
Infantry, consisting of a serjeant and six privates,
who had been entrusted with the care of
from fifteen to eighteen camels, fell asleep on
their posts, being overcome by the excessive
heat, and the Affghans, stealing upon them
whilst in this state, put one man to death, and
severely wounded two others, the whole of the
camels of course falling into their hands. The
serjeant escaped but was broken for neglect of
duty.</p>

<p>Shortly after this occurrence, two of the
marauders fell into our hands. In order to put
an end to, or diminish these vexatious losses it
was determined to make a terrible example of
the prisoners, in the hope that it would have
some effect upon their companions. They were
accordingly tried by a court martial, composed
of native officers, and sentenced to be blown
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
from the mouth of a gun. Having been led
into the market-place at Candahar, they were
ordered to draw lots as to who should first
undergo this dreadful doom. The younger of
the prisoners, a stripling of about nineteen
years of age, whose firm and gallant bearing excited
universal sympathy and admiration, responded
to this command by at once embracing
the mouth of the gun from which he was
instantly blown to atoms. His companion, a
grey-headed man, upwards of sixty years of
age, sat looking on, unmoved at this terrible
scene, and coolly smoking his hookah. On
being ordered to take his place at the gun he
did not exhibit the least appearance of fear, and
just as the match was about being applied, the
officer in command arrested it and directed the
prisoner to be taken away, the Shah influenced,
it is said, by the entreaties of Sir Alexander
Burnes, having granted his pardon. This unexpected
release from the very jaws of death
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
produced as little emotion on the part of this
stout old man, as its near approach or the fate
of his youthful companion had elicited.</p>

<p>The mysterious and premature death of
Cornet Inverarity, of the 16th Lancers, formed,
whilst here, the universal topic of discussion in
the military circles. The circumstances, as
far as I could collect them, were these:&mdash;A
pic-nic party had been given by the officers of
the regiment at a pleasant rural retreat, within
a few miles of Candahar, and the Cornet,
being fond of fishing, took his rod and
strayed a short distance from his companions in
search of sport. His prolonged absence having
given rise to remark, some of the party went
in search of him, and found the unfortunate
gentleman lying dead on the banks of a neighbouring
stream. The wounds he had received
were of such a nature as to preclude the idea
that they were self-inflicted, and there can be
but little doubt that he was murdered by the
Affghans. The deceased was an officer of considerable
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
acquirements, and was regretted by
all who had the honour of his acquaintance.
He was only in his 26th year, and had been
about five in the service.</p>

<p>I gladly avail myself of the opportunity
which presents itself of paying a tribute to the
good conduct and friendly feeling of the native
troops, who testified on all occasions the utmost
willingness, and indeed the most anxious desire
to render all the aid and service in their power
to their European comrades. Their knowledge
of the language of the country, and their acquaintance
with the value of its produce, proved
of no small advantage to us in our daily traffic
with the cunning and thievish traders of the
bazaar. Let me add that the general feeling
amongst us was that, in privation or danger,
we might always count with certainty on the
generosity and bravery of the Sepoy.</p>

<p>Having passed nearly seven weeks at Candahar,
it was determined that we should next
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
proceed to Ghuznee, where it was reported that
Dost Mahommed and his followers had resolved
on making a stand. The army quitted the
encampment on the 27th of June, preceded by
a squadron of European cavalry, two squadrons
of the native troops, and two field pieces loaded
with canister and grape shot. The route from
Candahar to Ghuznee lies through a wild and
mountainous country, and over roads extremely
difficult, and at times almost impassable. The
Ghiljies fled on our approach to the numerous
mud forts with which these hills abound, and
seldom ventured on our track. In the
dwellings they had abandoned we found only
a few old crones and hungry dogs, both of
whom received us with a sort of howling
welcome. The Ghiljie huts are constructed
somewhat like a bee hive, being of circular and
conical form, with interior accommodations of
the most wretched description. The few males
whom we caught a glimpse of were clad in the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
same substitute for broad cloth that served the
famous Bryan O'Lynn, who having&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"No breeches to wear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cut up a sheepskin to make him a pair."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We were lucky enough to discover the stores
of corn and <i>bussorah</i> (a sort of provender for
cattle) which the natives had buried at the
first news of our approach. We were also well
supplied with water the country being traversed
in all directions by rivers and streams. To
counterbalance these advantages we were annoyed
with shoals of locusts, which literally
darkened the atmosphere and kept up a perpetual
buzzing and humming in our ears. The
locust appears to be a favorite article of food
with the natives, who roast it on a slow fire and
devour it with eagerness. We could not bring
ourselves to relish this equivocal dainty,
although our rations were not of the best or
most varied description.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>As we advanced on Khelat-i-Ghiljie scarcely
a day passed without some Chief coming into
camp from Cabul, with a retinue of from one
to two hundred men, in order to tender his
allegiance to the Shah. They were immediately
sent to the rear and incorporated with his
Majesty's levies. Many of these new auxiliaries
brought camel batteries, which created a
good deal of curiosity and amusement amongst
the European troops, to whom they were a
novelty. Each camel carried a sort of rampart
on his back, which mounted from four to six
swivel guns of small calibre, the conductor both
driving the animal and serving the guns. We
were surprised at the rapidity and accuracy
with which these portable batteries were served
and brought to bear, the animal dropping on its
knees wherever it became necessary to bring
the guns within range, and rising the moment
they were discharged.</p>

<p>At Hyder Khail we were plundered of several
camels laden with bedding, belonging to her
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
Majesty's 2nd, or Queen's Royals, and the party
in charge of them disappeared and was not
again heard of before we left. As we passed
<ins class="corr" title="Khelat-i-Giljie">Khelat-i-Ghiljie</ins> the country 
began to improve in
its character, and large tracts, covered with
corn and beans, betokened the presence of a
more civilized tribe than that through whose
inhospitable territories we had just passed. The
villagers came daily into camp with fruit and
vegetables, which they parted with at reasonable
prices, and their conduct to us on the
whole was civil and peaceable.</p>

<p>On the 21st. of July we arrived in sight of
Ghuznee, the strength of which we found
underrated rather than exaggerated. Ghuznee
may be said to form the key to Cabul since it
commands the only direct route to that place.
The citadel is of great extent, and includes
within its <ins class="corr" title="precints">precincts</ins>, three or four 
bazaars and
several streets. It is surrounded on every side
by strong bastions and substantial walls, the
whole of which had been recently put in repair,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
and it mounted nine guns (one a 48 pounder)
besides innumerable wall pieces, gingals, and
matchlocks. The principal entrance is at the
North side, on the road to Cabul, and is approached
by a bridge of slight construction,
thrown across a deep ditch or moat. To
the right and left stretch long chains of lofty
hills, which approach the walls so closely on
the North side, as to command a view of the
interior of the citadel. The enemy, sensible of
the importance of these heights, had lined
them with troops in order to prevent our
planting batteries on them. At the distance
of about three quarters of a mile from the fort,
and situated in an amphitheatre of hills, lies
the town of Ghuznee, which consists of only a
few narrow, straggling streets. A narrow, but
deep and rapid river, whose banks are studded
with rich corn fields, winds its devious route
through the pleasant valley in which the town
is situate, and half encircles its walls. Nearly
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
equidistant from the town and the fort, and
surrounded by luxuriant orchards and vineyards,
stands the famous tomb of Mahommed
of Ghuznee. It consists of an oblong building
36 ft. by 18, and about 30 feet in height, and
is crowned by a mud cupola. The gates are
said to be of sandal-wood, and were taken from
the temple of Somnath by the conqueror, whose
remains lie entombed here. The grave stone
in the interior is made of the finest white
marble, but its once rich sculpture is now
nearly defaced, and it presents but few traces
of the Arabic characters with which it was
formerly inscribed. Over the last resting
place of the hero, and in a sadly decayed state,
are suspended the banner of green silk, and the
enormous mace which he had so often borne in
battle.</p>

<p>In the plain to the south of the hills stand
two pillars, or obelisks, of brickwork, about
one hundred feet in height, and twelve in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
diameter at the base, which are said to have
marked the limits of the bazaar of ancient
Ghuznee, and which at present form serve only
as conspicuous landmarks for the traveller.</p>

Enemy.&mdash;Rejoicings
of the Garrison at our Supposed Defeat.&mdash;Preparation
for a Coup de Main.&mdash;Engineer Operations.&mdash;Storming
and Taking of the Fortress.</p>

<p>We debouched on the plain in front of the
fort about eight o'clock in the morning, and
advanced upon it in three columns&mdash;the Cavalry
on the right, the Artillery in the centre, and
the Infantry on the left. The Commander-in-Chief
determined to reconnoitre the place in
force, and make the enemy show their strength.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
On approaching the orchards and walled gardens
before described, we found them occupied
by the enemy, and the 1st Brigade having
been immediately thrown into them, drove the
Affghans out of the enclosures in capital style,
and forced them to take shelter behind the
defences, with a comparatively trifling loss
on our side. Our guns were now brought
to bear upon the fortress, which had kept up
a sharp fire on us from the moment of our
appearance, but owing to our having left our
heavy battering train behind us at Candahar
we did but little or no damage. About eleven
o'clock we drew off, and pitched our camp out
of range of the fire of the foot. On our
skirmishers retiring from the gardens they were
immediately occupied by the enemy, who commenced
cheering our retreating parties, in the
conviction that they had obtained a victory.
Under this impression they instantly sent off
expresses to Cabul, to announce the fact, and
state that if the whole of the surrounding
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
country could be raised, they had little doubt
of being able to cut us off to a man. The garrison
spent the night in rejoicings, and blue
lights were constantly sent up as signals to
their friends on the neighbouring hills.</p>

<p>Next morning the Shah's camp was threatened
on the left by large bodies of horse and
foot who were driven off by the Cavalry <ins class="corr" title="and 
and">and</ins>
some of his Highness's troops; whilst
another force, consisting chiefly of horse, under
the command of one of Dost Mahommed's
sons; and at a short distance from him a
Ghiljie Chief, with about fifteen hundred
Cavalry, who had hung upon our flank all the
way from Khelat-i-Ghiljie, menaced us to the
right. This determined the Commander-in-Chief
to expedite matters, and the engineers
having made a careful inspection of the fortress,
he resolved on carrying it by storm. The
whole of the 22nd was consumed in making
the necessary preparations, the field hospital
being got ready while strong detachments of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
Cavalry scoured the country around, in order
to keep the enemy from our lines.</p>

<p>In order to give my readers a correct idea
of the strength of the fortifications, and the
difficulties overcome by the intelligence and
courage of the officers and men of the British
Army, I cannot do better than to copy the
official reports made by the principal Engineer
officers on the subject. They contain a full
detail of the operations up to the moment when
the citadel fell into our possession.</p>

<p><i>Memorandum of the Engineers' operations
before Ghuznee, in July, 1839, by Captain George
Thompson, Bengal Engineers, Chief Engineer
Army of the Indus.</i></p>

<p>The accounts of the Fortress of Ghuznee,
received from those who had seen it, were such
as to induce his Excellency the Commander-in-Chief
to leave in Candahar the very small
battering train then with the Army, there being
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
a scarcity of transport cattle. The place was
described as very weak, and completely commanded
from a range of hills to the north.</p>

<p>When we came before it on the morning of
the 21st of July we were very much surprised
to find a rampart, in good repair, built on a
scarped mound about thirty-five feet high,
flanked by numerous towers, and surrounded
by a faussebraye and wet ditch. The irregular
figure of the "enceinte" gave a good flanking
fire, whilst the height of the citadel covered
the interior from the commanding fire of the
hills to the north, rendering it nugatory. In
addition to this, the towers, at the angles, had
been enlarged, screen walls had been built before
the gates, the ditch cleared out and filled
with water, stated to be unfordable, and an outwork
built on the right bank of the river so as
to command the bed of it.</p>

<p>The garrison was variously stated from three
to four thousand strong, including five hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
Cavalry, and from subsequent information we
found that it had not been overrated.</p>

<p>On the approach of the army, a fire of artillery
was opened from the body of the place,
and of musketry from the neighbouring gardens.
A detachment of Infantry cleared the
latter, and the former was silenced for a short
time by shrapnells from the Horse Artillery,
but the fire from the new outwork on the bank
of the river was in no way checked. A nearer
view of the works was, however, obtained from
the gardens which had been cleared. This was
not at all satisfactory. The works were evidently
much stronger than we had been led to
expect, and such as our army could not venture
to attack in a regular manner. We had no
battering train, and to besiege Ghuznee in
form, a much larger one would be required
than the army ever possessed. The great command
of the parapets from sixty to seventy
feet, with the wet ditch, were insurmountable
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
obstacles to an attack, either by mining or
escalading.</p>

<p>It therefore became necessary to examine
closely the whole <i>contour</i> of the place, to discover
if any other mode of attack could be
adopted. The engineers, with an escort, went
round the works, approaching as near as they
could find cover. The garrison were on the
alert, and kept up a hot and well regulated fire
upon the officers whenever they were obliged
to show themselves. However, by keeping
the Infantry beyond musket range, and the
Cavalry at a still greater distance, only one
man was killed, and another wounded; the
former being hit by men sent out of the place
to drive off the reconnoitring party.</p>

<p>The fortifications were found equally strong,
all round, the only tangible point observed
being the Cabul gateway, which offered the
following advantages for a <i>coup-de-main</i>. The
road to the Gate was clear, the bridge over the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
ditch unbroken, there were good positions for
the Artillery within three hundred yards of
the walls on both sides of the road, and we had
information that the Gateway was not built
up, a reinforcement from Cabul being expected.</p>

<p>The result of this reconnaisance was a report
to His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief,
that if he decided upon the immediate attack
on Ghuznee, the only feasible mode of proceeding,
and the only one which held out a prospect
of success was a dash at the Cabul gateway,
blowing the gate open by bags of powder.</p>

<p>His Excellency decided upon the attempt,
the camp was moved that evening to the Cabul
road, and the next morning, the 22nd, Sir John
Keane in person reconnoitred the proposed point
of attack, approved of the plan, and gave orders
for its execution. Preparations were made
accordingly, positions for the artillery were
carefully examined, which excited the jealousy
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
of the garrison, who opened a smart fire upon
the party.</p>

<p>It was arranged that an explosion party, consisting
of three officers of Engineers, Captain
Peat, Lieutenants Durand and McLeod, three
Serjeants, and eighteen men of the Sappers in
working dresses, carrying 300℔s. of powder in
twelve sand bags, with a hose seventy-two feet
long, should be ready to move down to the
gateway at daybreak.</p>

<p>At midnight the first battery left camp,
followed by the other four, at intervals of half
an hour. Those to the right of the road were
conducted to their positions by Lieutenant
Stuart, those to the left by Lieutenant Anderson.
The ground for the guns was prepared
by the Sappers and Pioneers, taking advantage
of the irregularities of the ground to the right,
and of some old garden walls to the left.</p>

<p>The Artillery was all in position, and ready
by 3 A. M. of the 23rd, and shortly after, at
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
the first dawn, the party under Captain Peat
moved down to the gateway, accompanied by
six men of her Majesty's 13th Light Infantry,
without their belts, and supported by a detachment
of the same regiment, which extended to
the right and left of the road; when they
arrived at the ditch, taking advantage of what
cover they could find, and endeavouring to keep
down the fire from the ramparts, which became
heavy on the approach of the party, though it
had been remarkably slack during the previous
operations; blue lights were shown, which rendered
surrounding objects distinctly visible,
but luckily they were buried on the top of the
parapet instead of being thrown into the passage
below.</p>

<p>The explosion party marched steadily on,
headed by Lieutenant Durand; the powder
was placed, the hose laid, the train fired, and
the carrying party had retired to tolerable cover
in less than two minutes. The Artillery opened
when the blue lights appeared, and the musketry
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
from the covering party at the same time.
So quickly was the operation performed, and
so little was the enemy aware of the nature of
it, that not a man of the party was hurt.</p>

<p>As soon as the explosion took place, Captain
Peat, although hurt by the concussion, his
anxiety preventing him from keeping sufficiently
under cover, ran up to the gate, accompanied
by a small party of her Majesty's 13th
Light Infantry, and ascertained that it was
completely destroyed. There was some delay
in getting a bugler to sound at the advance, the
signal agreed on for the assaulting column to
push on, and this was the only mistake in the
operation.</p>

<p>The assaulting column, consisting of four
European Regiments (her Majesty's 2nd regiment,
Bengal European regiment, her Majesty's
13th Light Infantry, and her Majesty's 17th
regiment) commanded by Brigadier Sale, the
advance under Lieutenant Colonel Dennie,
accompanied by Lieutenant Sturt, Engineers,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
moved steadily through the gateway, through a
passage inside the gateway, in a domed building,
in which the opening on one side rendered
everything very obscure, and making it difficult
to find the outlet into the town. They
met with little opposition; but the party of
the enemy seeing a peak in the column, owing
to the difficulty in scrambling over the rubbish
in the gateway, made a rush, sword in hand,
and cut down a good many men, wounding
the Brigadier and several other officers.
These swordsmen were repulsed, and there was
no more regular opposition; the surprise and
alarm of the Governor and Sirdars being so
great when they saw the column occupying the
open space inside the gate, and firing upon
them, that they fled, accompanied by their
men, even the garrison of the Citadel following
their example. Parties of the Affghans took
refuge in the houses, firing on the column as
it made its way through the streets, and a good
deal of desultory fighting took place in consequence,
by which some loss was sustained. The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
Citadel was occupied as soon as daylight showed
that it had been abandoned by the enemy, and
the whole of the works were in our possession
before 5 <span class="smcap">A. M.</span></p>

<p>We lost seventeen men, six European and
eleven Natives killed&mdash;eighteen officers, and
one hundred and seventeen Europeans, and
thirty Natives wounded&mdash;total one hundred
and eighty-two. Of the Affghans more than
five hundred and fourteen were killed in the
town, that number of bodies having been
buried, and about one thousand outside by the
Cavalry, one thousand six hundred prisoners
were taken, but I have no means of estimating
the number of wounded.</p>

<p>There were nine guns of different calibres
found in the place, a large quantity of good
powder, considerable stores of shot, lead, &amp;c.,
&amp;c., and a large supply of attar and other
provisions.</p>

GEO. THOMSON, Capt. Engrs.<br />
<i>Chief Engineer Army of the Indus.</i><br />
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>
<p>The following report by Captain Peat, of
the Bombay Civil Engineers, gives a more
detailed account of the operations for blowing
up the gate, which, it will be seen, were attended
with difficulties of no ordinary nature.</p>

<p>"During the reconnaissance the wall pieces
were particularly troublesome. This weapon is
almost unknown in our service, but it is a very
efficient one, especially in the defence of works,
and its use should not be neglected. Every
fortified post should be supplied with a proportion
of them, and a certain number of men in
every regiment practised in firing them.</p>

<p>The charge recommended by Colonel Pasley,
for blowing open gates is from sixty to one
hundred and twenty pounds, and this is, doubtless,
sufficient in ordinary cases; but in this
instance we were apprehensive that the enemy
might have taken alarm at our being so much
on that side of the place, and in consequence,
partially or wholly, built up the gateway. It
was afterwards found that some attempts of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
kind had been made by propping up the gate
with beams.</p>

<p>The charge was so heavy, that it not only
destroyed the gate, but brought down a considerable
portion of the roof of the square
building in which it was placed, which proved a
very considerable obstacle to the assaulting
column, and the concussion acted as far as the
tower, under which an officer's party of her
Majesty's 13th regiment were standing at the
time, but without occasioning any casualties.
In cases of this nature it is of course the first
object to guard against any chance of failure;
and it is impossible, even now, to say how much
the charge might have been reduced with
safety.</p>

<p>The enemy appeared so much on the alert,
and the faussebraye was so much in advance of
the gate that we never contemplated being able
to effect our object by surprise. The only
question was, whether it ought to be done by
day or night. It was argued in favor of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
former, that the Artillery would be able to
make so much more correct practice that the
defences would be in a considerable degree
destroyed, and the fire so completely kept under
as to enable the explosion party to advance with
but little loss, and with the advantage of being
able to see exactly what they were about.
Captain Thompson, however, adhered to the
latter, and we were afterwards convinced it
was the most judicious plan; for although the
fire of the Artillery was necessarily more
general than it would have been in daylight,
still it was so well directed as to take up a good
deal of the attention of the besieged, and draw
upon their batteries a portion of the fire, which
in daylight would have been thrown down upon
the explosion party and assaulting columns.
It would also, even in daylight, have been
difficult, with our Light Artillery, to have kept
down the fire so completely but that a few
matchlock men might have kept their position
near the gateway; and in that narrow space a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
smart fire from a few pieces might have obliged
the party to retire. The obscurity of the night,
to say nothing of the confusion which it must
occasion among undisciplined troops, is certainly
the best protection to a body of men engaged
in an enterprise of this nature. Blue lights
certainly render objects distinctly visible, but
their light is glaring and uncertain, especially to
men firing through loopholes.</p>

<p>The party consisted of eighteen officers,
twenty-eight sergeants, seven buglers, and two
hundred and seventy-six rank and file.</p>

<p>It was made of this strength, not only to keep
up a heavy fire upon the parapets, and thereby
divert attention from the party at the gateway,
but also because we were not aware whether
the faussebraye was occupied or not, and as it
extends so much in advance as to take the gate
completely in reverse, it would have been
necessary, had a fire opened from it, to have
carried it by assault before the party with the
bags could have advanced. The party with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
Lieutenant Durand was accompanied by six
men of the 13th, without their belts, the better
to secure them from observation, to protect
them from any sortie that might be made from
the postern of the faussebraye on the right,
or even from the gate itself, while another
party under an officer, Lieutenant Jennings,
accompanied me as far as the tower so as to
check any attempts that might have been
made from the faussebraye on the left, and at
the same time keeping up a fire on such of the
enemy as showed their heads above the parapet;
of this party one man was killed and a few
wounded.</p>

<p>Nothing could have been more gallant than
the conduct of Lieutenants Durand and McLeod,
and the men under their command; or
more efficient than the manner in which they
executed their duty.</p>

<p>The powder being in sand bags of a very
coarse open texture, a long hose and port fire
was thought to be the safest method of firing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
it. The end of the hose fortunately just
reached the small postern. The casualties,
however, during this operation were much fewer
than was expected, being in all one private
killed, two sergeants, and twenty-three rank
and file wounded.</p>

<p>The heaviest fire was certainly outside the
bridge, for the enemy near the gateway being
marked, whenever they attempted to shew their
heads above the parapet, were obliged to confine
themselves to the loop-holes, the range
from which is very uncertain and limited
against men moving about. A high loop-holed
wall, although imposing in appearance, is a
profile but ill adapted to resist attacks of this
nature.</p>

<p>The enemy were perfectly aware that we
were in the gateway, but appeared to have no
idea of the nature of our operations. Had they
been so they might easily have rendered it
impossible to place the powder bags, by
throwing over blue lights, of which they had a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
large quantity in store. The powder pots and
other fire works so much used by the natives of
Hindoostan would certainly have rendered the
confined space leading to the gate much too hot
for such an operation; but the ignorance of
the besieged was known and calculated upon,
the result shows how justly.</p>

<p>Their attempts at resistance were confined
to the fire from the loopholes and throwing
over large pieces of earth, some of which
appeared to be intended to knock off the port
fire.</p>

<p>I on this occasion received an excellent lesson
on the necessity of not allowing preconceived
opinions to lead to any carelessness, in accurately
ascertaining the result of any operation
of this nature. The gateway appeared, from
what I had seen from the hills to the north, to
lead straight into the town, and on running in
to examine it after the explosion I was so much
impressed with this idea and so much convinced
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
of the probability of the gateway having been
blocked up during the day, that I was led to
believe that it had actually been done, from
seeing, in front of the gate that had been
destroyed, the outline of an arch filled up with
brick masonry. The true entrance turned to
the right and would have been discovered by
advancing a few paces, and that in perfect
safety, for the interior was secure from all fire.
Lieutenant Durand on first going up saw from
through the chinks of the gate that there was
a light and a guard <ins class="corr" title="immedialely">immediately</ins> 
behind it, and
from that circumstance was convinced that no
interior obstacles of importance existed.</p>

<p>My mistake therefore was luckily immediately
corrected without any bad consequence
resulting.</p>

<p>A party of sappers with felling axes, and
commanded by Lieutenant Wemyss, and two
scaling ladders in charge of Lieutenant Pigan,
accompanied the assaulting column.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>Of ten Engineer Officers engaged in this
attack, only one, Lieutenant Marriot, was
slightly wounded. Captain Thompson however
had a very narrow escape, having been thrown
down by a rush of some swordsmen into the
gateway, and nearly sabred while upon the
ground."</p>

<p>The Cavalry taking no part in these operations
I was an idle, but not the less an anxious
spectator of the scene. I had never before
witnessed effects so awfully grand, or so intensely
exciting in their nature as those which
immediately preceded and followed the explosion
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
at the gates. The atmosphere was
illuminated by sudden and powerful flashes of
various coloured light which exposed the walls
and bastions of the fortress to view, and revealed
the dusky figures of the garrison, in the
act of pointing their guns, or endeavouring to
penetrate the denseness of the obscurity beneath,
in order to assure themselves of the position
of their assailants. Then followed the din and
roar of artillery&mdash;the terrific explosion of the
gates&mdash;the crash of woodwork and masonry&mdash;the
hollow rumbling of the old towers as they
came in huge masses to the ground&mdash;the rush
of the storming party through the breach, and
the deafening cheers and shouts of besiegers
and besieged. It seemed as if all the elements
of destruction had been let loose at once, and
yet I panted to be in the midst of them. I
hardly dared to breathe from the very intenseness
of my anxiety, and it was not till I saw
the British flag floating from the citadel, that I
could respire freely. To the soldier there is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
nothing more trying or chafing than to be condemned
to a state of inaction during the progress
of such spirit-stirring events as these.</p>

<p>While the Affghans were disputing our
entrance into the citadel an incident occurred,
which for a moment diverted the attention of
the combatants and turned their fury into
pity. Amongst the foremost of the party who
signalised themselves by their desperate gallantry
was an aged Chieftain, the richness of
whose costume excited general attention, his
turban and weapons being resplendent with
jewels. The hope of plunder immediately
marked him out as an object of attack, and
numbers at once assailed him. He defended
himself like a man who knew there was no
chance of life, but who was resolved to sell it
as dearly as he could. He had killed several of
the Queen's Royals and severely wounded
Captain Robinson, when a grenadier of the
company to which the latter belonged, seeing
his officer in danger, rushed to his assistance,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
and with a thrust of his bayonet brought the
gallant old Chieftain to the ground. The
grenadier was about to despatch him, when a
beautiful girl, about seventeen, threw herself
into the <i><ins class="corr" title="mélée">mêlée</ins></i> and plunged a dagger 
in his
breast. She then cast herself on the body of
the Chieftain, for the purpose of protecting it,
and the Affghans, forming a sort of rampart
before them, maintained their ground until the
heroic girl succeeded in getting it conveyed
into the interior of the citadel. Shortly after
the place was taken she was found weeping
over the remains of the brave old man, who, on
enquiry, we learned was her father. She was
treated with the utmost respect and tenderness
by our men, who neither obtruded themselves
on her grief nor offered any interruption to
the preparations which she made for his
interment.</p>

<p>Amongst the prisoners who fell into our
hands was Hyder Khan, a son of Dost
Mahommed, and late commandant of the fortress.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
This Chief was discovered hiding in a
privy by a soldier of the Queen's Royals, who
would have bayonetted him but for the timely
interference of one of his officers, who chanced
to be near the spot. The Affghan leader was
immediately brought before Sir John Keane,
and the Shah being present rated him soundly
for his treachery. He replied only by a
haughty look of defiance, and was consigned to
a tent closely guarded by Sepoys. The sword
found upon this Chief, and which is at present
in the possession of Sir John Keane, was
valued at 14,000 rupees.</p>

<p>Of the many prisoners we had taken, the
capture of none afforded such gratification as
that of Ghool Mahommed Khan, to whose bad
faith some of our past privations had been
owing. This Chief had entered into a contract
with Sir Alexander Burnes, to establish magazines
of provisions and corn at Quettah, for
the use of the British troops, and five thousand
rupees were paid over to him for the purpose.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
He purchased up all the corn of the surrounding
districts, but instead of fulfilling his agreement
he forwarded it to Ghuznee for the use
of the garrison, and was amongst the most
conspicuous defenders of the fortress. On
being brought before the Shah his Majesty
ordered him to be bowstringed, but before the
sentence could be carried into effect he managed
to escape. His treachery failed in its object,
for the greater portion of the flour and
grain which he had supplied now fell into our
hands. We also found from five to six hundred
horses in the stables of the fortress, all of which
were in excellent condition, and ranging in
value from seventy to a hundred pounds
each.</p>

<p>I entered the fort shortly after it surrendered
and at every step spectacles of the most
shocking and revolting nature met the eye.
Round a long twenty pounder, which was
planted to the right of the entrance, lay heaps
of dead Affghans, who appeared to have attached
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
the greatest importance to the service
of this piece from the numbers who crowded
to perform the duty whenever our fire killed
those engaged in it. The agonising cries and
groans of the wounded wretches who lay
stretched at every side, and who craved drink
to sate their burning thirst, struck those who
had not been engaged in the fearful excitement
of the scene with horror and pity, whilst at
every turning a horse, wild with the injuries he
had received, was to be met galloping furiously
along the narrow streets, and treading the
bodies of the dying and dead under foot.
Advancing through the bazaar, my attention
was drawn towards a venerable looking Affghan,
who was seated on the ground with his back
propped against a wall, and whose richly ornamented
muslin robes were stained with blood,
which flowed profusely from a wound in his
breast. A fine looking youth of about fourteen
years of age was attempting to stanch it, and
I hastened to proffer my assistance. The old
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
man, however, pushed me back, and would not
let me approach him, plainly indicating by his
gestures that he held me and my countrymen
in abhorrence. Whilst standing at a short
distance from him, a straggling ball came
whizzing past me, whether intentionally or accidentally
I cannot say, and put an end to his
sufferings. Some soldiers, who afterwards examined
the person of this old chief, for such
from his attire I took him to be, discovered
amongst other things an extremely well executed
map, on which the whole of the route of
our troops from the point at which we had
disembarked to our arrival at Ghuznee was
plainly indicated.</p>

<p>Some of the Affghan women were occasionally
to be met turning over the bodies of the
dead, in the hope of being able to discover
their relations or friends, and giving way to
their grief in the most heart-rending lamentations.
They were the most superior class of
women I had as yet seen amongst the Asiatics,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
their features being regular, and finely formed,
and their eyes piercing, but at the same time
soft in their expression. Although nothing
like violence was used towards them, they did
not escape some incivilities at the hands of our
men, owing to the fact that a number of Affghan
soldiers had attempted to escape in female
disguise.</p>

<p>Various were the adventures related amongst
us, as having occurred on the first entrance of
our troops into the fortress. A Scotchman,
belonging to my own regiment, named James
Hamilton, who was known to be an inveterate
snuff-taker was discovered in a tobacconist's
shop in the bazaar literally covered from head to
foot with the contents of the <i>chatties</i> or jars
with which it was filled, and testing the
qualities of each with an air of the most exquisite
relish, his nose having been long a stranger
to its favourite aliment. The ruling passion
was exemplified in different ways in others.
Some sought for drink, of which there was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
little to be obtained and others for gold, which
we had every reason to believe was plentiful, if
we knew but where to find it. A soldier of the
13th Light Infantry, more fortunate than his
fellows, lit unexpectedly on a jar which was
filled to the brim with gold pieces to the value
it is said of £600 sterling, and conveyed it
secretly to the camp. Becoming apprehensive
that this large sum would be discovered on
him, and that he would be obliged to give it up
to the prize agent, he distributed it amongst
several of his comrades in order that they
might take care of it. The possession of
so much wealth turning the heads of his
trustees they thought they might allow themselves
a few indulgences at his expence, but
their excesses ultimately betrayed the secret
and they were compelled to hand over the
money to the common fund.</p>

<p>As the soldiers severally left the fortress to
return to the camp they were stripped of the
plunder which they had obtained, and a goodly
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
heap of armour and weapons of every kind
was soon piled before the entrance. Amongst
the number of curious articles obtained in
this way was an old shield, which had belonged
to one of the Affghan chiefs and
which, though remarkable for the oddness of
its construction, presented little else to attract
the eye. Its material appeared to be a compound
of copper and some white metal, and it
was thrown aside by the prize agent amongst
the most valueless of the objects which fell
under his care. A soldier of the Bengal European
regiment, who had been a jeweller by
trade, happened to observe the circumstance,
and carelessly taking up the shield, as if to
examine the devices with which it was ornamented,
scrutinized it for some time, and went
away without making the slightest observation.
He immediately repaired to the Captain of his
company, and told him to bid for the shield
at the prize sale which was to take place a few
days afterwards, advising him not to stop at
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
any reasonable price for it. The officer acted
on the hint, and obtained the article for about
thirty or forty rupees. The shield turned out
to be of the purest and finest gold, and the
fortunate possessor felt so grateful to his informant
that he made him a present sufficient
to purchase his discharge, and carry him home
to England.</p>

<p>Amongst the different ensigns captured from
the enemy on this occasion were two banners
of green and crimson silk, trimmed with gold
lace and inscribed with precepts from the
Koran. They were desperately defended, the
Affghans appearing to attach great importance
to their safety. They are, I believe, at present
in the possession of her Majesty's 17th Light
Infantry, and the Bengal European Regiment.</p>

<p>Shortly after the breach had been effected
intelligence was brought to the <ins class="corr" title="Commander-in 
Chief">Commander-in-Chief</ins>,
that numbers of the enemy were making
their escape through one of the back gates.
He immediately dispatched the 1st Bombay
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
Light Cavalry in pursuit. The Affghans
being daring horsemen, and better mounted than
our men, made at once for the hills, where
they knew our Cavalry could not follow.
Aware of this our men put their horses to their
utmost speed, in order to intercept them before
they got entangled in the defiles. The chase
soon assumed a character of lively interest.
An Affghan, worse mounted, or less skilled in
horsemanship <ins class="corr" title="then">than</ins> his fellows, was 
overtaken
and cut down, and the pursuers pressed hard
on the heels of another. The cheers of his
enemies, and the clatter of their horses' hoofs
sounding fearfully near in the ears of the pursued
he put the noble animal on which he was
mounted to its utmost speed, and cleared the
space between him and his companions at a
bound rather than a gallop. Again he was
almost within reach of the sabres of our men,
and again did the fleetness of his horse place
him for a time in safety. As he was about to
plunge into a deep ravine after the other fugitives
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
a shot brought his horse upon its knees,
and the rider was flung upon his head. All
now seemed over with him. Starting, however,
to his feet, he turned upon his pursuers,
and single handed opposed a host of them.
Warding off the blows which rained on him
from every side, he kept rapidly retreating
until he gained the brow of a steep declivity
over which he flung himself and was instantly
lost to view. Disappointed in their pursuit,
our men took an unmanly revenge on some
peasants who were peaceably engaged in agricultural
occupations near the spot. One of
these wanton acts of cruelty met with a just
retribution. A havildar or serjeant, seeing a
young Affghan following the plough at a little
distance, galloped up, and made several cuts at
him with his sabre. The young man ran to the
other side of the plough, and placed the serjeant
at bay. The latter drew a pistol from his holster,
and was about to shoot him, when his horse
stumbled over the plough and fell on his side,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
breaking the leg of the havildar and pinning
him at the same time firmly to the ground.
The Affghan seized the sword which had fallen
from his grasp, and dealt him a blow on the
head which instantly killed him. The comrades
of the dead man riding up surrounded
and captured the peasant, and he was brought
into camp to abide the decision of the Commander-in-Chief.
A representation having
been made to Sir John Keane of the wanton and
unprovoked attack which had been made upon the
prisoner, he immediately ordered him to be
liberated. The havildar was interred on the
spot where he fell and there were few in the
army who pitied or regretted him.</p>

<p>A few days after the taking of Ghuznee a
tragical scene occurred, which pretty clearly
indicated how the tide of popular feeling ran
with regard to the restored monarch. There
is a poetical superstition that approaching
events are often foreshadowed, and the circumstance
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
to which I allude seemed to impress
every man's mind at the time with the result
that has since happened.</p>

<p>The majority of the prisoners who fell into
our hands were released on condition of their
serving in the Shah's army, but there remained
about thirty who refused to accept of their
liberty on such terms. They consisted for the
most part of the immediate followers of Dost
Mahommed's father-in-law, and were devotedly
attached to that prince. The Shah, on learning
the <ins class="corr" title="circumstanee">circumstance</ins> ordered them to be 
brought before
him, and expostulated with them on the folly
of their conduct. A Chief of haughty bearing
stepped from amongst the prisoners, and
after overwhelming his Majesty with reproaches,
told him that nothing should induce him to
enter the service of a man who had brought
the horrors of foreign invasion on his country.
Then suddenly snatching a dagger from one
of the attendants, he rushed with uplifted arm
towards the Shah, and would have pierced him
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
to the heart had not one of his Majesty's servants
interposed his person, and received the
blow intended for his master. The faithful
domestic fell dead at the feet of the Shah,
and the officers and attendants instantly rushed
towards the assassin with drawn swords; but
he had already anticipated their intention by
plunging the poniard in his breast. The Shah,
alarmed and exasperated, ordered the whole of
the prisoners to be immediately executed, and
in a few minutes their heads were rolling in
the dust. This terrible scene created great
alarm in the camp, it being at first reported
that his Majesty had been assassinated, but
the apprehensions to which it gave rise were
soon dispelled, by his publicly making his
appearance amongst us.</p>

<p>A Chief, named Walla Mahommed, who
had persisted in firing on the troops several
hours after the taking of the fort, and in spite
of repeated summonses to surrender, was
brought to a court martial by order of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
<ins class="corr" title="Commander-in Chief">Commander-in-Chief</ins>, and 
sentenced to be shot
within the walls of the fortress. He had
killed three or four of our men, and wounded
one of the Native officers by his obstinate
folly. He met his fate with the most perfect
indifference, for the fear of death cannot be
said to be one of the weaknesses of the Affghan
character.</p>

<p>I one day paid a visit, with some of my comrades,
to the hospital where the wounded Affghans
had been carried by their friends. It
was situated in the old town, and consisted of
a mud hut, whose thatched roof was broken in
several places, and afforded little or no shelter
against the heat of the sun. The interior was
as filthy and disgusting as it is possible to
conceive. Into a space of about thirty feet by
twelve, were crowded from seventy to a hundred
patients, who were disabled by wounds of
every description, their sufferings being aggravated
tenfold, by the intolerable heat and stench
of the place. They were attended by two
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
elderly men and a youth about fifteen years
of age, who were busily engaged dressing their
wounds, whilst a Faquir was performing certain
charms, by which he <ins class="corr" title="pretented">pretended</ins> he could 
restore
them to health. Pitiable and disgusting as the
scene was I could not help laughing at the
mummeries of the fellow. He first placed
some cow dung in the hand of the sufferer, and
holding it in his, saturated it with water and
compelled the patient to smell it. He then
wound up the ceremony by repeating some
prayers over the fumes of a charcoal pan, the
patient repeating after him certain responses
which he directed him to make. This done,
he covered him up with an old blanket, and
ordered him to lay quiet for several hours,
when the cure would be complete. Having of
course received a consideration for all this
trouble, he left his patients to the progress of
the charm, and the discovery, when too late,
that they had been grossly duped.</p>

<p>Happening to have a quantity of apples
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
with me which I had just plucked from one of
the orchards in the vicinity, I offered them to
the sufferers in the hope that they would in
some degree refresh them. They accepted
them with eagerness which induced some sepoys
who were with me to follow my example. The
Affghans indignantly refused to receive anything
at their hands, and so great was their hatred
of the native troops, that they actually spat
upon the men who showed them this kindness.</p>

<p>Early in August we resumed our march
towards Cabul, leaving the whole of our sick
and wounded in garrison at Ghuznee. It was
reported that Dost Mahommed intended to
dispute every inch of ground to the capital, but
these valiant resolutions were abandoned as
soon as formed. The only indication of a preconcerted
plan of defence which we met with
on the route, was a battery of sixteen field
pieces which we found planted on an eminence
commanding the entrance to a formidable pass
about midway between Ghuznee and Cabul,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
but which had been deserted by the enemy as
soon as our advanced columns made their appearance.
A party of the Horse Artillery
having been sent to secure the guns and ammunition,
an accident took place which was attended
with fatal consequences. One of the
men having approached a tumbrel with a lighted
pipe a spark fell into it and the whole blew up
with a tremendous explosion, killing two of the
party and severely injuring another.</p>

<p>The conduct of the inhabitants of the
different villages along this route, whether
influenced by good will or fear, I cannot take upon
myself to say, was friendly and well disposed
towards us. This did not however prevent some
excesses on the part of the native troops, which
Sir John Keane sought to repress by issuing
an order forbidding the men from robbing the
villagers on pain of death. At Chesgow, about
two days march from Ghuznee, a soldier
belonging to the 2nd Bengal Light Cavalry
was observed thieving in the immediate vicinity
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
of the staff lines, and one of Sir John's aides
de camps who watched his proceedings took a
gun from his tent and deliberately lodged its
contents in his side. The unfortunate man
died of the wound, after lingering a few days.
The extreme severity of the punishment and
its informal nature, were bitterly canvassed
amongst the native troops, but it nevertheless
had the effect of preventing a repetition of
the offence.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the 7th of August,
we encamped without opposition under the
walls of Cabul, Dost Mahommed and his forces
having fled to the hills at the first news of our
approach. The Commander-in-Chief being
desirous of securing the person of the usurper,
immediately despatched Captain Outram, and
Hadji Khan, a chief supposed to be well affected
towards Shah Soojah, with a thousand Affghans
and a hundred native cavalry in pursuit.
They had not proceeded far from the camp
when it became evident to Captain Outram
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
that treachery was secretly at work, the Affghans
deserting daily, until their number was
diminished to about five hundred. Hadji Khan,
to whose guidance the force was entrusted, led
it by long and circuitous routes, under pretence
that they would thereby more easily intercept
the fugitives, and turned a deaf ear to the
Captain's entreaties that they should proceed
directly across the hills. Wherever a rapid
movement became necessary, the Affghan
managed so that his followers should be delayed
on the route, and there was no sort of impediment
that craft or ingenuity could suggest that
he did not employ to retard the progress of
the troops. Captain Outram having no authority
to act without the aid of the Khan was
obliged to shut his eyes to these man&oelig;uvres,
and succeeded after the most urgent persuasion
in inducing the Affghan Chief to proceed at
once to the hills, with a small detachment.</p>

<p>After traversing the highest parts of the
Hindoo Kosh, a chain of mountains, fifteen
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
thousand feet above the level of the sea, and
extending as far as Bamean, Captain Outram
found that Dost Mahommed had taken refuge
in the territories of an independent Uzbeck
Chieftain then at enmity with the Shah.
Whilst crossing the heights several blue lights
were thrown up by the orders of Hadji Khan,
which the British had reason to believe were
intended to give warning to the enemy. Further
pursuit through a difficult and hostile
territory became of course out of the question,
and the horses being worn out from want of
forage and rest, orders were given for the
return of the party to Cabul. During the
march homeward Hadji Khan contrived to give
the British the slip, and made off to the hills,
rightly calculating that his equivocal conduct
would be severely punished by the Shah. He
was, however, captured before the British left
Cabul, and sentenced to imprisonment for life.
It was said that the Commander-in-Chief was
dissatisfied with the conduct of Captain Outram
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
in this affair, and that he pointedly passed over
his name in the official despatches to mark his
displeasure.</p>

<p>As several descriptions of Cabul have been
published it will only be necessary for me to
give such of its leading features as are essential
to the completeness of my narrative. The
city lies almost in the centre of a semicircular
chain of hills, the valley in which it is situated
being watered by a noble river which pursues
a serpentine and picturesque route through it,
and divides the town in nearly equal parts.
The bazaar stands at the base of a lofty mountain,
up whose rugged sides straggle rude and
irregular fortifications of no great strength or
importance. The town itself covers a considerable
extent of ground, and the streets are in
general regular and well built as compared with
the other cities of Asia. Towering high above
the other buildings may be observed the mosque
and Balar Hissar or palace of the sovereign.
The latter is surrounded by beautiful gardens
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
and is entered by a large flagged court-way
leading to the principal portal of the edifice.
The proportions of the building are on a scale
commensurate with royalty, the centre being
surmounted by a lofty dome, and the wings of
vast extent. The right wing contains the
stabling of the Shah and chambers of the
household, and the left is appropriated to the
sovereign's own use. The general effect of this
building is heavy, and it conveys the idea of a
prison rather than a palace.</p>

<p>About half a mile to the right of the palace
stands the mosque which contains the remains
of the Emperor Baber. This temple is one of
the finest I have seen in this part of Asia,
being of great architectural beauty and noble
proportions. It is entirely composed of richly
carved stone-work, and is crowned by a number
of graceful spires and minarets. The interior
is magnificently ornamented with gilding and
sculpture, and the pavement is composed of rich
Mosaics of various coloured marbles. The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
tomb containing the remains of the Emperor
occupies the centre of the mosque, and is less
elaborately ornamented than any other part of
it, being composed of plain slabs of white
marble on which some extracts from the Koran
are inscribed.</p>

<p>The bazaar is of circular form, the streets
composing it radiating from an open space in
its centre, and presenting a thronged and busy
aspect. The principal articles of merchandize
which attracted our notice were cashmere shawls
of the richest and most expensive patterns,
and costly silks of every description. A considerable
trade is also carried on in preserved
fruits, which find their way from here to the
most distant parts of Hindostan. In the fruit
market we observed grapes which measured
nearly two inches in circumference; peaches,
whose rich bloom and luscious quality gratified
at once the eye and the palate; and strawberries,
such as the hot houses of Europe, and
all the inventions of horticultural science could
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
not force into existence. As to apples
and pears, fruits prized in the western
hemisphere, they were in such abundance
and of such low price, that they were
only deemed worthy of furnishing food for
cattle. Almost all the necessaries of life were
in equal profusion, beef fetching only a penny,
and mutton twopence the pound. It may be
readily imagined that to the tired and half-starved
soldier, Cabul appeared almost a second
land of promise.</p>

General's effects.&mdash;Arrival of Prince Timour.&mdash;The Sikhs.&mdash;Murder

<p>It having been announced that early on the
morning of the 8th of August the Shah would
take formal possession of the Balar Hissar, the
troops were under arms and in review order at
ten o'clock. The Commander-in-Chief, the
Politicals, and the whole of the general officers
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
and staff rode up, shortly after, to the tent of
his Majesty, at which I happened that morning
to be stationed as orderly, and were kept
waiting some time. Sir William McNaghten
and Sir Alexander Burnes were at length summoned
to the Shah's presence, and having
remained with him a few minutes, they came out
and informed the Commander-in-Chief, it was
his Majesty's pleasure that the ceremony should
be postponed until three o'clock the same
afternoon. The reason assigned for this alteration
was understood to be an augury pronounced
by his Majesty's priests or soothsayers,
that the hour was unpropitious, an opinion in
which the troops devoutly concurred, the
prospect of broiling for several hours under a
meridian sun not being extremely agreeable.</p>

<p>At the appointed hour the troops were
again under arms, and salvoes of artillery announced
the Shah's departure from his tent.
His Majesty was, as usual, borne on an elephant,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
the howdah of which was of silver, and
the caparisons crimson and gold. On each
side of him sat Sir William Mc Naghten and
Sir Alexander Burnes, the former attired in
the same court dress which he had worn at
Candahar. His Majesty appeared in excellent
health and spirits, and addressed much of his
conversation to Sir Alexander Burnes, who
seemed to be high in his favour. The Shah's
costume was, as usual, magnificent, his turban
being ornamented with a single diamond, whose
value was estimated at £100,000. Immediately
after came six elephants, containing the ministers
and household of the Shah, and then followed
the Commander-in-Chief, with the whole
of the general officers and staff in brilliant
uniforms, and decorated with their various
orders. The next feature in the procession,
and a ludicrous one it was, was the appearance
of two burly-looking fellows, dressed in red
and yellow, and wearing conical caps, out of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
which shot two large horns. We at first supposed
they were his Highness's jesters,
but instead of that they turned out to be his
executioners, functionaries far more essential
to the comfort of an Asiatic prince. The
Shah's troops, consisting of two thousand infantry,
brought up the rear, our own lining the
route along which the procession passed. On
approaching the city his Highness was received
with loud acclamations by the populace, who
gave expression to their satisfaction in barbarous
music and salvoes of small fire arms. Many
of the houses were decorated with flowers, and
the windows were crowded with spectators. At
the entrance, and in the courts of the palace, was
stationed a body of about 250 horsemen, whose
steel armour and splendid horses gave them a
martial and imposing appearance. They received
us with stern and scowling looks, which
plainly indicated that their hearts were not in
the ceremony which they were compelled to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
sanction by their presence. On the Shah's
entrance into the palace he held a durbar, at
which all the British officers were presented to
him, and his Majesty took the opportunity of
expressing to them individually and collectively
his thanks for the exertions which they had
made to replace him on his throne.</p>

<p>We had several reviews of the troops during
our stay at Cabul, and on each occasion we
were honoured by the Shah's presence. In order
to give his Highness some notion of an English
horse race, it was agreed that the officers
should get up sweepstakes amongst themselves,
which the Shah no sooner heard of, than he
added a splendid gold hilted sword with Damascus
blade. This increased the spirit of
competition, and the Derby or Oaks was
never looked forward to with more eager
interest. The place selected for the course
was a level plain immediately beyond our
lines, and about a mile and a half from the city.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>From sixteen to twenty horses belonging to
the officers of the different regiments were
entered for the sword, and it was resolved that
three heats should be run for it, the first six
horses of the first heat being privileged to run
the second, and the third heat being limited to
the first and second horses of the second heat.
It was agreed that the sweepstakes, which
amounted to a considerable sum, should be
divided into three parts, for the different breeds
and ages of cattle so as to prolong the sport for
three or four days.</p>

<p>Six o'clock in the evening being the time
fixed for the commencement of the races, the
course became crowded, long before that hour,
with anxious spectators, the natives not being
amongst the least eager lookers on at this, to
them, novel scene. The Shah took up his
position near the winning post, attended by
the Politicals, and the Commander-in-Chief,
but his Majesty did not appear to take much
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
interest in the sport, and he left the course
before it was half over.</p>

<p>The officers rode their own horses and turned
out in gay striped jackets and jockey caps;
so that but for the dark faces and turbaned
heads which every where encountered the eye
it would not have been difficult to imagine
ourselves suddenly transported to Ascot or
Epsom. The word having been given, away
started the competitors in high blood and
spirits; and as the rider belonging to some
particular regiment passed the others in his
career, the men composing it enthusiastically
cheered and hurraed him, others taking up
their shouts as their favourite passed him in
turn, this military favouritism imparting to the
contest a degree of wild excitement such as I
have never witnessed on any similar occasion.</p>

<p>The second heat was still more warmly
contested, as, according to the regulations
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
above mentioned only the two foremost horses
could be entered for the third. Major Daly
of the 4th Light Dragoons, and an officer of
the 16th Lancers, whose name I now forget,
obtained the precedence, after a hard struggle,
the race being a neck and neck one the entire
way.</p>

<p>As the two successful officers belonged to
different divisions, one to the Bengal and the
other to the Bombay army, the partizanship
which before had been only regimental now
extended to the two armies, and "Bravo
Bengal," "Bravo Bombay," burst at every
moment from the eager multitudes assembled,
as the riders alternately passed or repassed
each other in the final heat.</p>

<p>After a contest in which the competitors
themselves almost appeared to feel the influence
which pervaded the crowd, and to think that
the honor of their respective divisions depended
upon their success, Major Daly gained the race
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
by about a neck, and was handed the sword
amid the delighted cheers of the Bombay troops
and the congratulations of his brother officers.
The races continued two days longer, and
afforded a pleasant recreation to the men after
the fatiguing and harassing duties of the last
few months.</p>

<p>Brigadier General Arnold of the army of the
Indus, having been long suffering under a liver
complaint, breathed his last at Cabul shortly
after our arrival there. This officer was distinguished
for his qualities as a <i>bon vivant</i>, and
having laid in a good store of necessaries for
the campaign, was the only one almost who
fared well amidst the general privations. He
kept an excellent table along the route, and an
invitation to it, was always regarded as
amongst the lucky chances by which fortune
signified her favour. Good living could
not however protect the General against disease,
and he fell ill at Candahar of a malady which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
is often said to be the result of it. He was
carried from Candahar to Cabul in a palankeen,
and took no part whatever in the events which
occurred between those places. His remains
were interred in the Armenian burial ground,
outside the walls of the city, and his effects
were publicly sold by auction a few days after.
The General had left Bengal with about eighty
camels laden with baggage and necessaries, of
which about five and twenty remained at the
time of the sale. His trunks were filled with
quantities of plate, a goodly provision of snuff
and cigars, and such an immense stock of linen
that it occupied two days of the sale. His cooking
apparatus was most elaborate and ingenious,
and we could not help wondering at the uses to
which the infinite varieties of small and curious
articles of which it was composed were devoted.
The prices at which these effects were sold will
appear incredible to the European reader, but
it must be remembered that it was the scarcity,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
in fact the almost total impossibility of getting
them, that enhanced their value. The cigars
sold at the rate of about two shillings and six
pence each, the snuff at ten shillings an ounce,
a few bottles of beer, a liquor of which no
other officer in the army possessed a drop, at
thirty shillings each, and some choice wines at
from three to four pounds the bottle. The
other things brought proportionate prices, the
shirts fetching from thirty to forty shillings
each. The amount realised at this sale must
have been enormous.</p>

<p>Prince Timour, the eldest son of Shah
Soojah, arrived at Cabul early in September,
escorted by the troops of Runjeet Singh. We
expected to find the Sikhs an undisciplined
horde of barbarians, but they turned out on the
contrary to be nearly as well organized as ourselves,
being disciplined by French officers, and
marching with the same order and regularity
as a European regiment. Each division was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
headed by an excellent military band and officered
by the same number of grades as ourselves.
The men were in general about the middle
height, and not so muscular or well formed as
the Affghans. They are made, however, of the
right material for the soldier, being brave, orderly,
and tractable, and though they may be
considered in some respects inferior to the European
troops, they are in my opinion, equal if not
superior, to the Sepoys. A detachment consisting
of the 4th Light Dragoons, the 16th
Lancers, and her Majesty's Queen's Royals,
under the command of Major-General Sir
Thomas Wiltshire, was despatched to receive
the Prince with fitting honors. He was met at
a short distance from the town by the British
escort, and conducted to the palace amid salvoes
of Artillery. The Prince was a fine youth
about one or two and twenty, with a frank
expression of countenance and affable manners.
The meeting between him and his royal
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
father was said to be extremely affecting, and
the Prince was unceasing in his expressions of
gratitude to the British for bringing about this
happy reunion.</p>

<p>Large supplies of arrack, biscuits, and rice,
together with money to pay the troops, having
been promised from the Upper Provinces, their
arrival was looked forward to with some
anxiety in the camp, as we could not leave
Cabul without them. Information was at
length received that Colonel Herring was on
his way through the Punjaub, and after a
tedious and harassing journey, in which he had
to encounter frequent opposition to his progress
from the mountain tribes, he at length reached
Hyder Khail within one day's march of Cabul.
Riding out alone next morning, for the purpose
of inspecting the country, the Colonel was set
upon by a body of Affghans and barbarously
murdered, his body being plundered of every
article of value he had about him, and his horse
carried off. His mutilated remains were found
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
in the course of the day by some troopers, who
had been sent out in search of him, and brought
to Cabul along with the stores, which reached
that place in safety the same night. He was
interred with military honours in the Armenian
burial-ground, on the following day. The
deceased had been long in the service, and was
a gallant and experienced officer. We heard
that his murderers were captured shortly after
we left Cabul, and put to a dreadful death, by
order of the Shah.</p>

<p>In order to testify his gratitude towards the
British, the Shah resolved to institute an order
of merit, to be called the order of the Doorannee
Empire, and to confer its respective grades
upon three classes of officers, namely, Generals,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
Brigadier Generals, and Field Officers. A
durbar having been summoned, at which the
Ministers of State, the Politicals, and a number
of British Officers were present, a chapter of
the order was held, and his Majesty, as
Sovereign, invested the Commander-in-Chief,
several general and field officers, and the Politicals
with the decoration, which consisted of
a sort of Maltese cross with a jewel in the
centre. His Majesty was also pleased to express
his desire that every officer, non-commissioned
officer, and private soldier in the army
should receive a silver medal, commemorative
of the campaign, and for this purpose placed a
large sum of money at the disposal of Sir John
Keane. The Queen's sanction has been obtained
to the measure, but the medal has not
as yet been issued.</p>

<p>Leave had been given by the officers in command
of the different regiments to men entering
the town to carry their side arms, as a protection
in case of chance collision with the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
inhabitants. The facility of obtaining intoxicating
liquors rendered this a contingency of
not unlikely occurrence, and our men soon got
themselves into unpleasant and in some instances
dangerous scrapes. On one occasion, a
private of the 13th Light Infantry having been
drinking rather freely, forced himself into the
apartments of the wife of a respectable inhabitant.
Proceeding to offer her some violence,
her screams alarmed the neighbourhood, and
the soldier was soon surrounded by a host of
angry husbands and fathers, armed with every
description of weapon. He defended himself with
his bayonet for some time, contenting himself
with merely parrying their blows, and had
fought his way into the street, when he
was met by several others of the townspeople,
who set upon the unfortunate fellow and instantly
despatched him. They secreted the
body until night-fall, and then threw it outside
the walls of the town, where it was discovered
next morning.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>It having been determined that early in
September part of the forces should set out on
their return homeward, the choice fell upon
her Majesty's 17th Foot, the 2nd or Queen's
Royals, one Company of Foot Artillery, a
detachment of the 4th Light Dragoons, the 1st
regiment of Bombay Light Cavalry, and two
troops of Bombay Horse Artillery, the whole
under the command of Major General Sir
Thomas Wiltshire. It would naturally be
supposed that after so long an absence from
quarters, we hailed this intimation with something
like pleasure, but such was far from
being the fact. We had rioted in profusion
and luxury, and did not relish the idea of
again encountering the privations of the long
and dreary route which lay between us and
India. Added to this we had seen but little
of actual fighting, and the promotions had been
consequently few.</p>

<p>Promotion and prize money are the all engrossing
subjects of a soldier's ambition, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
this speedy return put an end at once to our
long cherished hopes. We well knew that the
restless and turbulent spirit of the Affghan
Chiefs would not permit them to remain long
in subjection to Shah Soojah, and that there
would consequently be more work for the
British troops. Regret and envy of our more
fortunate comrades were therefore the predominant
feelings which pervaded nearly the
whole of the departing troops.</p>

<p>We left Cabul on the 14th of September,
and arrived at Ghuznee, the scene of our former
exploits, after eight days' march, during
which nothing worthy of mention occurred.
It is astonishing how soon the traces of war
disappear, and the living gaps caused by its
ravages are filled up. The fortress appeared
as perfect in its outline as if the hand of the
destroyer had not recently passed over it, new
gates having been substituted for those which
had been damaged, and the breach immediately
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
above them re-filled with masonry. The inhabitants
of the bazaar had resumed their
accustomed occupations, and scolded, and chaffered,
and jested, and laughed, as if they had
neither lost relatives nor friends, nor dabbled
through mire freshly reeking with their blood.
Familiarity, they say, breeds contempt and
blunts the feelings, and the Asiatic, before
whose eyes such scenes pass almost daily, thinks
of them only as the immutable decrees of fate,
which cannot be shunned, and ought not to be
repined at.</p>

<p>The sick and wounded, of whom we had
left numbers at Ghuznee, had almost all died,
and were interred in an open space selected for
the purpose outside the walls of the fortress.
The last resting-place of our brave fellows is
situated at the foot of one of the adjacent
mountains, but neither stone nor inscription
indicates the spot.</p>

<p>The Bengal regiment of Native Infantry,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
whom we found in garrison at Ghuznee on our
return, and whom we left after us, appeared to
be quite as well reconciled to their quarters
as we were at Cabul, although the two
places appeared to me vastly different in point
of health and comfort. The majority of the
inhabitants regarded the troops with a sort of
sullen indifference, but the trading classes
seemed civil enough. The quantities of fish
and game with which the neighbourhood
abounded, afforded the officers a ready means of
dissipating their time, and we would have been
well content to have remained here. Orders
were however given that we should pursue our
route, and we left Ghuznee on the 25th of
September, after a stay of only two or three
days.</p>

<p>Instead of diverging to the right towards
Candahar, we took the direct route to Quettah,
over the Ghiljie hills. The weather had
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
become intensely cold, and the rivers and
streams were covered with ice, several inches in
thickness. The Rev. Mr. Pigot, our chaplain,
happened to be crossing one of them on a pony,
when the ice gave way with his weight, and
the worthy clergyman was immersed in the
water. The stream was not, however, so deep
as to occasion any alarm for his safety, and
he was speedily rescued from his embarrasment,
with no other inconvenience than being kept
shivering several hours in his wet clothes, his
baggage being at a considerable distance in advance.
The rascally native who preceded us as
guide grinned maliciously, and told him that
if he had not forgotten to say his prayers
setting out the accident would not have happened.</p>

<p>On encamping, at the close of the first day's
march, from Ghuznee, some soldiers belonging
to the 17th Infantry and Queen's Royals, went
out in search of water, and met with a draw
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
well, which proved to be dry. One of them
descended in order to examine it more closely,
and an exclamation of horror escaped him
as he reached the bottom. On his companions
enquiring the occasion of it, they
learned that he had fallen upon several skeletons,
the identity of which with some soldiers
we had lost on the route upwards was placed
beyond doubt by fragments of military clothing
and regimental buttons which lay scattered
about. Singular to relate, a lark had
built its nest in one of the skulls, and was
found innocently reposing with its young in
this curious receptacle.</p>

<p>The annoyances to which we had been subjected
during our route upwards, from the
thieving system of warfare pursued by the
Affghans, seemed now at an end. Our road
lay through bleak and desolate hills, where
only a solitary, and timid mountaineer was
occasionally to be seen. Numerous rivers and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
streams traversed this wild country in every direction,
and relieved us from all apprehensions
on the score of water. Provisions were also
plentiful, as the Commissariat had taken care
to lay in sufficient supplies, and the only inconvenience
which we might be said to have
experienced was the severe cold of the nights.
The barren nature of the country rendered
fuel difficult of obtainment, and the consequence
was that numbers of the troops were
carried off by dysentery.</p>

<p>The march from Ghuznee to Quettah occupied
about five weeks, and we thought we
should never reach the end of these long chains
of hills. Always ascending and descending
heights of no inconsiderable elevation, the
horses became regularly knocked up with
fatigue, and we were obliged to shoot numbers
of them on the way.</p>

<p>In a recess in one of these hills, I one day
came upon a singular scene. About nine or
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
ten of the natives were assembled around a
dead horse and while part of them were cutting
steaks from his haunches, the others were
engaged cooking them. Revolting as such a
sight is to European stomachs, I have seen the
time when, on our march upwards, I could
have partaken of these same horse steaks with
infinite relish.</p>

<p>A few days before our arrival at Quettah,
we requited an atrocious act of treachery,
which had been committed towards us by some
Ghiljie chiefs, with the punishment it richly
merited. About one hundred camel drivers,
who had left us at Candahar, on our way to
Cabul, for the purpose of returning homewards,
took their route over the hills we were
now crossing in order to shorten the journey.
They were met by the Ghiljies with professions
of friendship, and seduced into a mountain
fort under the pretence of hospitality.
They had no sooner entered its walls than
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
their throats were all cut, and their bodies
flung into deep wells for the purpose of concealing
the massacre from the eyes of the
British.</p>

<p>Information of the fact having been received,
Sir Thomas Wiltshire despatched a Squadron
of her Majesty's 4th Light Dragoons, two
companies of Native Infantry, and two pieces
of artillery to raze the fortress to the ground.
The cavalry started at two o'clock in the
morning, and after a hard gallop of eighteen
miles we arrived in front of the Ghiljie <ins class="corr" title="strong
hold">strong-hold</ins>. It was a small but strongly constructed
fortress, situated on the brow of a steep declivity
and defended by strong wooden gates.
The entrance was commanded by an old iron
carronade, and a number of loopholes for the
discharge of musketry. Not a living soul was
to be seen on the walls, and fearing some
artifice, Major Daly, our commanding officer,
resolved to suspend operations until the artillery
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
came up. As soon as the latter made its
appearance, and the guns were placed in a position
to command the fort, Major Daly ordered
part of the cavalry to dismount and
proceed with loaded carbines to the gate, under
cover of their fire. No opposition was, however<ins class="corr" title="missing 
comma added">,</ins>
offered to us, the enemy having fled to
the mountains, and the gates were forced open
in a few minutes.</p>

<p>The only inhabitants we found in the place
were a few women and children, but we
discovered quantities of the richest silks and
carpets, beside arms and money (consisting
principally of silver coins) the fortress being a
sort of depot for the booty obtained by these
highland marauders.</p>

<p>One of the cavalry having entered a dwelling
in search of plunder, was suddenly seized
by two or three Ghiljies, who unexpectedly
made their appearance through a sort of trap,
with which almost every house in the fort was
furnished. They placed a bandage over his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
eyes, and were in the act of passing a rope
round his arms, when the timely approach of
some of his comrades saved him from being
carried off as a prisoner, the enemy disappearing
through the trap the moment they heard
the noise of their footsteps at the entrance.
The troopers would have willingly pursued
them, but the depth and darkness of the subterraneous
passage convinced them it was
something more than a mere cellar, and they
knew that if they once got involved in its
windings they would be completely at the mercy
of the enemy. It is probable that these passages
had outlets without the walls, and that it was
through them the enemy made their escape at
the first news of our approach, the suddenness
and quickness of our movements preventing
them from taking their valuables with them.
There was also abundance of cattle and grain,
of which we brought off large supplies to the
camp. Orders having been given to the Artillery
to blow up the fortress, the women and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
children were sent out of it, and at five o'clock
the same day the walls were breached, so as to
render them completely useless, and the houses
fired in all directions. After remaining to see
that the work of destruction was complete, we
quitted the place at three o'clock in the morning,
and arrived the same day at the encampment.
The enemy were not entirely without
their revenge, for, following on our footsteps,
and watching us closely, they contrived to carry
off the cook, and three camels laden with the
cooking utensils of the squadron, a loss which
was severely felt, and by some thought ill compensated
by the booty we had obtained.</p>

and Arrival at Bombay.</p>

<p>We reached Quettah on the 29th of October,
and the army separated into two divisions
there, one to proceed by the fortress of Khelat,
to punish the Khan for the treacherous trick
which he had played us on our way up, and the
other to return homeward through the Bholun
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
Pass. The force destined for military operations
against Khelat consisted of her Majesty's 2nd
or Queen's Royals, her Majesty's 17th regiment
of Foot, the 35th Bengal Native Infantry, one
company of Foot Artillery, one troop of Horse
Artillery, with the Poona Irregular Horse, the
whole under the command of Major-General
Sir Thomas Wiltshire. As my detachment
was not included in this expedition, owing to
the fatigued condition of the horses, and the
difficulty of procuring forage on the route, I
can only describe the storming of Khelat from
the reports of those who were present at it.</p>

<p>The fortress of Khelat was very little inferior
to Ghuznee in point of strength, being defended
by strong breastworks and mounted with
large cannon. The garrison consisted of from
twelve to fourteen hundred men, and there was
abundance of provisions and ammunition in the
place. After reconnoitring its position Sir
Thomas Wiltshire resolved on carrying it by
storm, and the affair was a short but brilliant
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
one. A battery was erected on one of the
neighbouring heights, and a well directed fire
soon brought the gates down. The stormers
then rushed up the causeway under cover of
our guns; but before they had reached the
gateway, a heavy fire from the loopholes of the
fortress killed from twenty to thirty of our
troops, amongst whom was Lieutenant Gravatt,
who was gallantly leading them on. A desperate
hand to hand fight then ensued, the enemy
resisting in dense masses, and disputing every
inch of ground; but our men carried all before
them, at the point of the bayonet, and drove
the enemy into the interior of the fortress,
where they were headed by the Khan himself.
The old Chieftain fought with desperation and
though frequently offered quarter, indignantly
refused to accept it. He and the followers by
whom he was surrounded were all bayonetted
on the spot, and in about four hours the whole
of the fortress was in the possession of our
troops. In the immediate vicinity of the place
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
where the Khan was killed, a shocking spectacle
presented itself. His favorite women, about
twelve or fourteen in number, lay heaped
together in a pool of blood, their throats
having been cut by order of the Khan, to prevent
their falling into our hands. A large
quantity of treasure, consisting of specie and
jewels, was found in the citadel, and had the
Cavalry been present more would have fallen
into the hands of our troops, as the enemy
were observed despatching it to the hills, on
camels, through one of the back gates, during
the heat of the assault. Amongst the various
effects which were captured on this occasion
were several boxes of arms and accoutrements,
which had been plundered from us on our way
to Cabul, and a telescope and some books,
which had belonged to one of our officers.
Cattle and grain were also found in great
abundance, and proved of no small service to
the division, on its route homeward, through
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
the Gundava pass. The fortress was completely
dismantled before the departure of the troops,
and the Chiefs and other prisoners liberated on
promising allegiance to the Shah.</p>

<p>Amongst the residents whom we found at
Quettah on our arrival was a Bombay Parsee,
who had ventured up to that place with supplies,
consisting of tea, sugar, hams, brandy,
beer, wines, and other necessaries. To the
soldier as well as the officer these articles were
a welcome treat, and having plenty of money
to purchase them we soon exhausted the stores of
the enterprising trader who had reason to congratulate
himself on the successful issue of his
trip.</p>

<p>The morning previous to our departure a
suicide occurred under circumstances which gave
rise to the suspicion that the wretched perpetrator
of it intended to have preluded it by the
crime of murder. A trooper belonging to the
Horse Artillery was placed under arrest for
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
some trifling neglect of duty, and as soon as he
was liberated he took a loaded pistol and went
directly to the tent of the adjutant of his corps
who had fortunately quitted it a few minutes
before. The disappointed trooper returned to
his lines and immediately blew his own brains
out.</p>

<p>We left Quettah on the 1st of November,
about nine o'clock at night, taking with us the
sick who had been left behind on our way to
Cabul, and who were now sufficiently restored
to proceed homeward. In consequence of the
scarcity of water on the route we were obliged
to make a forced march of eight and twenty
miles, and reached the entrance to the Bholun
Pass at six o'clock the next morning. We
entertained a lively recollection of the reception
we had met with on our former passage
through this defile, and now felt some misgivings
that we should not be allowed to retrace
our steps without a repetition of the favours
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
which were then so liberally showered upon
us. To our great gratification and contentment,
however, the Belochees offered us no
sort of obstruction, and could they have facilitated
our progress through their country,
would, I have little doubt, been well inclined
to do so. We occasionally caught glimpses of
them watching our movements at a respectful
distance, but they never ventured within musket
shot during the whole of our passage. We
lost two or three men from sickness before we
cleared the defile, and found it almost impossible
to inter them from the stony nature of the
strata with which the whole of this district is
covered.</p>

<p>Quitting the Bholun we proceeded to Dadur,
and thence to Bagh, through a jungle abounding
with every sort of game, but more particularly
deer and wild boar. The troops made
their way with considerable difficulty through
the intricacies of this entangled route, the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
pioneers being in constant requisition to clear
a passage for them.</p>

<p>On the 24th of November we arrived at
Bagh, a village situated at the Cabul side of
the desert, elsewhere described. The place
consists of a few miserable huts, surrounded by
fields of joharra, and containing only one tank
of stagnant water. Doctor Forbes, of the 1st
Light Cavalry, an officer universally esteemed
for his benevolence, hearing that the
Natives were dying in numbers of the
cholera, immediately hastened to the village
to tender his services. He was seized by the
<ins class="corr" title="epedemic">epidemic</ins>, and returned to his quarters 
in a
dying state. The unfortunate gentleman expired
in a few hours afterwards, and was
interred the same day. Five or six of the
European troops were attacked in like manner,
and were immediately hurried to the hospital
tents, where two of them died, but the others
struggled successfully against the disease.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
Brigadier Scott, taking alarm at these unequivocal
evidences of malaria, gave orders that
we should proceed across the desert without a
moment's delay, and we accordingly struck our
tents at four o'clock the same day, carrying our
sick along with us. On reaching the extremity
of the desert we found the 1st regiment of
Bombay Grenadiers, with a large convoy of
provisions and stores for the use of the army.
These supplies should have reached us at the
other side of the Bholun, but the escort had
been attacked by the cholera on the route, and
were obliged to remain stationary until the
disease had abated. We found them nearly all
convalescent and about to continue their route.
We took from them a stock of provisions, and
pursued our march.</p>

<p>We arrived at Shikarpoor with a great number
of sick who had fallen ill of the epidemic
on the way, and it was resolved that we should
remain here a few days. Shikarpoor is a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
large well built town, and contains two fine
mosques, several roofed bazaars, and two or
three large manufactories. The British Resident
has a fine house here, the gardens of which
are tastefully laid out in the European style.
Notwithstanding the clean looking appearance
of the town it is far from being healthy, and
from ten to twelve of our troops were daily
carried off by the cholera during our stay.
Amongst the number was Captain Ogle of the
4th Light Dragoons, who fell a victim to his
humanity in visiting the sick of his troop.
This lamented gentleman was only in his
thirtieth year, and was a great favourite with
his corps. He was unfortunately a married
man, and had been looking forward with feelings
of eager anticipation to his reunion with
his family. Being of a buoyant and joyous
temperament, his loss was felt severely in the
circle of his brother officers; his ready jest
and imperturbable good humour rendering him
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
the life and soul of the mess table. Captain
Ogle looked upon the private soldier as something
more than a mere automaton placed at
his disposal, and whilst he had always a due
regard for the discipline of the service, he exercised
the power entrusted to him with humanity
and judgment, the act in which he
lost his life being but the last of a countless
series of generous and disinterested offices
which he was in the habit of performing for
those under his command. Few men have left
behind them a memory so associated with
every thing that is valuable and estimable in
social and military life.</p>

<p>Leaving Shikarpoor, on the 27th of November,
we arrived on the following day at Sukkur
Bukkur, a town situated on the banks of the
Indus, and having its citadel on a rock in the
centre of the river. The cholera rapidly disappeared
here; but we sustained another loss in
the person of Lieutenant Janvrin, the acting
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
Quarter-Master of our detachment, who was
carried off by the small-pox. On the opposite
bank of the river lies Roree, a village remarkable
only for its manufactures, which consist
principally of silks. Several of us having
obtained leave to visit the place, we were
strolling through the bazaar, when we observed
preparations for a wedding in progress. Taking
up a position which enabled us to see what was
passing, without obtruding on the parties concerned,
we waited patiently until the ceremonies
commenced. At the expiration of about a
quarter of an hour the bridegroom made his
appearance in front of the house which contained
his betrothed, and both in person and
attire he was all that a native belle could have
desired. He was a fine, muscular looking
fellow of about seven or eight and twenty,
with handsome features and bold and jaunty air.
He was dressed in a loose robe, of spotless
white, and without any ornaments or weapons
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
whatsoever. Proceeding directly to the door
of the house which contained his Dulcinea he
knocked at it three times with the knuckles of
his right hand and once with his left. He then
threw himself prostrate on a mat which had
been made for the purpose, by the lady's own
hands, and there waited her coming forth. The
door presently opened, and a number of musicians
immediately struck up a wild and discordant
air. A timid and pretty looking
maiden, about fourteen years of age, showily
dressed in different coloured silks, and ornamented
with a nose ring and bangles of pure
gold, at length stepped forth, followed by her
relatives and friends, who formed themselves
into a circle around her. The bridegroom starting
to his feet made a formal claim to the hand
of his affianced and presented her with a
garland of flowers, which she gracefully threw
across her shoulders, in token that she accepted
him, and then suffered him to embrace her.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
Lifting her in his arms he placed her on the
back of a donkey, and they went in procession
to pay visits of ceremony through the town,
the bride distributing sweetmeats to the crowd,
as she passed along. The bridegroom showered
his favours about in the form of some red
powder, which he flung in the faces of all near
him, and especially in those of the Europeans,
of whom there were a good many present. He
half blinded some of us, and conferred as dark
a hue as his own upon others&mdash;freaks that appeared
to give infinite delight and amusement
to the natives, but which were not taken in
quite as good part by some testy fellows
amongst us. Having arrived at the house of
the bridegroom's father, the old gentleman
graciously descended, and taking the bride in
his arms, bore her into his dwelling. The
bridegroom remained a few minutes after them,
and flinging some cowries to the musicians and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
crowd, he made a salaam and darted in after
his <i>inamorata</i>.</p>

<p>We remained at Sukkur about six weeks, in
consequence of an order forwarded after us by
Sir William Mc Naghten, under the apprehension
that our services would be again
wanted at Cabul. The Indus being navigable
up to the town, we had plentiful supplies of provisions
and other necessaries at moderate prices,
and felt tolerably satisfied with our quarters.
As to the probability of our having to return
to Cabul, the Cavalry felt at ease regarding
the rumours which prevailed, for they well
knew that the condition of their horses put
such a thing completely out of the question.
An order at length arrived that the various
brigades of the Bombay column should be
broken up, and that the troops composing them
should return to their respective quarters.
Brigadier General Scott, and his aides de camp,
accordingly left us by one of the first boats
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
which sailed down the Indus for Bombay, and
we remained under the command of the officers
of our respective regiments.</p>

<p>We passed our time hunting in the jungles,
in the vicinity of the camp, or in fishing in the
river, both of which proved prolific sources of
amusement. I went out several times to chase
the wild boar, and on one of these occasions
the sport nearly proved fatal to me. Proceeding
with two of my comrades, and a native for
guide, through a dense and almost impenetrable
part of the jungle, we suddenly roused a huge
boar, which turned fiercely upon us, and made
directly at the nearest of its pursuers, which,
as chance would have it, happened to be me. He
had me down on the earth in a twinkling, and
would have made short work of me had not a
well-directed shot from one of my companions
struck him right between the eyes, and tumbled
him lifeless on the ground. The man to
whom I owed my safety exhibited admirable
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
coolness, and self-possession, for the slightest
deviation in his aim would have sent the bullet
through me instead of the object for which it
was intended. It was with the greatest difficulty
we contrived to drag our prize into
camp, for he weighed no less than from twenty-five
to thirty stone, and supplied the troop
with pork chops until we were tired of them.</p>

<p>The importance of Sukkur as a military position
cannot be exaggerated. It forms the
key to Scinde, and the Indus being navigable
up to the fortress, its supplies do not depend
on season or circumstance. These advantages
have not been overlooked, for it has since
been retained in the possession of our troops,
and will always serve as a <i>point d'appui</i> in any
future operations we may undertake at that
side of the Indus.</p>

<p>After passing nearly six weeks at Sukkur,
we took the route to Larkhana along the right
bank of the Indus. The road lay, as before,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
through a jungle, and the occasional glimpses
which we caught of the river through the
clearances gave a picturesque effect to the
scenery. We arrived at Larkhana on the 19th
of January, and remained there only one day.
Proceeding thence to Sehwan we reached the
latter place in about four days, and found a
gun boat belonging to the Hon. Company
lying at moorings in the river. We left
Sehwan on the following day, and taking a
farewell of the River Indus we proceeded towards
the coast through a wild and deserted
district, in which we found neither villages nor
inhabitants.</p>

<p>Within one day's march of Kurrachee we
found a number of tombs richly sculptured
and covered with inscriptions from the Koran,
which were said to contain the remains of
some of the native princes. There being abundance
of excellent water here, and Kurrachee
having the reputation of not being extremely
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
healthy, it was determined that we should
remained encamped here until the Khelat division
formed a junction with us. It was not
till the end of February, however, that the
Khelat forces made their appearance, having
kept us waiting about five weeks, and on the
day after their arrival we marched into Kurrachee
where we found her Majesty's 40th
regiment.</p>

<p>Kurrachee is situated on the Coast of Belochistan,
and its natural advantages entitle it to
the rank of a first rate sea-port town. It possesses
a fine harbour, in which a seventy-four
gun ship may ride in safety, and which is protected
by the batteries of the town, and the
guns of a fortress occupying an island about
midway between the mainland and the promontory
which forms the harbour. On our
arrival at Scinde, instructions had been forwarded
to Commodore Pepper, by the Commander-in-Chief,
to invest the place, and we
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
accordingly found it in possession of our troops
on our return.</p>

<p>The town is large but irregularly built, and
is surrounded by walls and bastions, on which
we saw some pieces of cannon, but they were
of small calibre, and of the worst possible
construction. To the north of the town we
observed a superb banyan tree, which extended
its foliage to such a distance, that it formed a
pavilion capable of containing a small stone
mosque for the accommodation of a number of
Faquirs or priests. Of the many curious specimens
of this class that I have met with in
Asia, I have seen none so utterly degraded
and isolated from every thing like humanity.
Their bodies were thickly coated over with
ashes and red paint, and their hair clotted with
filthy moisture. They were surrounded by
every sort of abomination, and howled and
whined like a set of wild beasts. That they
had not reduced themselves to this savage
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
state merely from fanaticism we had abundant
opportunities of discovering, for we saw the
inhabitants of Kurrachee daily pouring into
the temple with rich presents and offerings,
and propitiating their good will by sacrifices
of their most precious and valuable effects.
To the left of the Mosque lies a tank, or
reservoir, about fifty feet long by thirty broad,
in which we saw a number of live alligators,
which are carefully fed by the priests, and
held in the greatest possible veneration and
awe by the deluded votaries who repair
there.</p>

<p>The feast of the Mohurrum had commenced
a few hours before our arrival, but we were in
time to witness the greater part of it. A short
description of these singular rites may not be
uninteresting to the reader. A hole being dug
in the ground to the depth of about six or eight
feet, fire is placed in it, and the devotees dance
round it, with the most extravagant exclamations
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
and gestures, some dashing square pieces
of iron or brass together, to add to the effect.
According as one set of dancers becomes
fatigued they are replaced by another, and thus
the ceremonies are kept up without intermission
from sunset to daybreak. When the moon is
at its full they march in procession to the
water's side, preceded by their Taboots, a sort
of fantastical temple, constructed of bamboo
and gilt paper. I have seen one of these
temples, at Poona, of such large dimensions
that it required an elephant to draw it, and
cost no less a sum than a thousand rupees. On
reaching the water's side the taboots are thrown
in and allowed to float away with the tide.
This concludes the ceremonies and the wearied
performers are glad to return to their homes.</p>

<p>On returning towards the lines, from the
Mohurrum, we saw a miserable looking wretch
squatted at the side of the road, who appeared
to be in deep affliction, for he was weeping
bitterly and lamenting his hard fate. I addressed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
him and inquired into the cause of his
grief. He told me that he had been induced to
become a convert to Christianity by one of
the missionaries, and had been thrust out of the
pale of social intercourse from the moment
the fact became known. He deplored his
having yielded to the arguments of the missionary,
since they had debarred him from
participating in the religious ceremony which
had just terminated, its pomp and circumstance
having evidently made a deeper impression on
his imagination than his conviction. We gave
him some relief and passed on, when our
attention was again directed to him by one of our
companions, who had lingered behind. Several of
the natives had surrounded the poor convert, and
were spitting upon him, and loading him with
the vilest reproaches. We returned to the spot
and compelled them to leave him in peace.</p>

<p>Amongst the British whom we found on our
arrival at Kurrachee was Mr. Masson, the
author of an interesting work on Affghanistan,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
which has been lately published. This gentleman
had been originally a private soldier in the
Honourable Company's service, and had risen
through various grades to the profitable civil
employ which he at present holds. He rendered
some important services to the company,
for which they awarded him a pension of £100
a-year, and much to his credit he settled the
whole of it on his aged mother.</p>

<p>After remaining at Kurrachee about ten
days, the order was at length issued for the
embarkation of the Cavalry, which was now
limited to my own detachment. Upwards of
thirty <i>pattemars</i> were hired for the voyage, and
from twelve to fourteen men, and an equal
number of horses, were stowed in each. We
had a quick and favourable passage, and arrived
at Bombay on the 10th of March, after an
absence of nearly eighteen months.</p>

<h2><a id="APPENDIX"></a>APPENDIX.</h2>

<p class="center">FROM THE DELHI GAZETTE <ins class="corr" 
title="EXTRAORINARY">EXTRAORDINARY</ins>,
OCTOBER 1, 1842.</p>

<p><br /><br />"The Right Hon. the Govenor-General of
India having with the concurrence of the
Supreme Council, directed the assemblage of
a British force for service across the Indus,
his Lordship deems it proper to publish the
following exposition of reasons which have led
to this important measure.</p>

<p>"It is a matter of notoriety that the treaties
entered into by the British Government in the
year 1832 with the Ameers of Scinde, the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
<ins class="corr" title="Nawah">Nawab</ins> of Bahawulpore, and Maharaja Runjeet
Singh, had for their object, by opening the
navigation of the Indus, to facilitate the extension
of commerce, and to gain for the British
nation in Central Asia that legitimate influence
which an interchange of benefits would naturally
produce.</p>

<p>"With a view to invite the aid of the <i>de facto</i>
rulers of Afghanistan to the measures necessary
for giving full effect to those treaties,
Captain Burnes was deputed, towards the close
of the year 1836, on a mission to Dost Mahomed
Khan, chief of Cabul: the original
objects of that officer's mission were purely
of a commercial nature.</p>

<p>"Whilst Captain Burnes, however, was on his
journey to Cabul, information was received by
the Governor-General that the troops of Dost
Mahomed Khan had made a sudden and unprovoked
attack on those of our ancient ally,
Maharaja Runjeet Singh. It was naturally to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
be apprehended that his Highness the Maharaja
would not be slow to avenge this aggression,
and it was to be feared that the flames of war
being once kindled in the very regions into
which we were endeavouring to extend our
commerce, the peaceful and beneficial purposes
of the British Government would be altogether
frustrated. In order to avert a result so
calamitous, the Governor-General resolved on
authorising Captain Burnes to intimate to Dost
Mahomed Khan, that if he should evince a disposition
to come to just and reasonable terms
with the Maharaja, his Lordship would exert
his good offices with his Highness for the
restoration of an amicable understanding between
the two Powers. The Maharaja, with
the characteristic confidence which he has uniformly
placed in the faith and friendship of the
British nation, at once assented to the proposition
of the Governor-General, to the effect
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
that in the mean time hostilities on his part
should be suspended.</p>

<p>"It subsequently came to the knowledge of
the Govenor-General that a Persian army was
besieging Herat; that intrigues were actively
prosecuted throughout Affghanistan, for the
purpose of extending Persian influence and
authority to the banks of, and even beyond, the
Indus; and that the Court of Persia had not
only commenced a course of injury and insult
to the officers of Her Majesty's mission in the
Persian territory, but had afforded evidence of
being engaged in designs wholly at variance
with the principles and objects of its alliance
with Great Britain.</p>

<p>"After much time spent by Captain Burnes
in fruitless negotiation at Cabul, it appeared
that Dost Mahomed Khan, chiefly in consequence
of his reliance upon Persian encouragement
and assistance, persisted, as respected his
misunderstanding with the Sikhs, in urging the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
most unreasonable pretensions, such as the
Governor-General could not, consistently with
justice and his regard for the friendship of
Maharajah Runjeet Singh, be the channel of
submitting to the consideration of his Highness;
that he avowed schemes of aggrandizement
and ambition injurious to the security and
peace of the frontiers of India; and that he
openly threatened, in furtherance of these
schemes, to call in every foreign aid which he
could command. Ultimately, he gave his
undisguised support to the Persian designs in
Affghanistan, of the unfriendly and injurious
character of which, as concerned the British
power in India, he was well apprised; and by
his utter disregard of the views and interests of
the British Government compelled Captain
Burnes to leave Cabul without having effected
any of the objects of his mission.</p>

<p>"It was now evident that no further
<ins class="corr" title="inteference">interference</ins> could be exercised by 
the British
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
Government to bring about a good understanding
between the Sikh ruler and Dost Mahomed
Khan; and the hostile policy of the latter
chief showed too plainly that so long as Cabul
remained under his government we could never
hope that the tranquillity of our neighbourhood
would be secured, or that the interests of our
Indian empire would be preserved inviolate.</p>

<p>"The Governor-General deems it in this
place necessary to revert to the siege of Herat
and the conduct of the Persian nation. The
siege of that city had now been carried on by
the Persian army for many months. The
attack upon it was a most unjustifiable and
cruel aggression, perpetrated and continued
notwithstanding the solemn and repeated remonstrances
of the British Envoy at the Court
of Persia, and after every just and becoming
offer of accommodation had been made and
rejected. The besieged have behaved with
gallantry and fortitude worthy of the justice of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
their cause, and the Govenor-General would
yet indulge the hope that their heroism may
enable them to maintain a successful defence
until succours shall reach them from British
India. In the mean time the ulterior designs
of Persia, affecting the interests of the British
Government, have been by a succession of
events, more and more openly manifested.
The Governor-General has recently ascertained,
by an official despatch from Mr. M'Neil, Her
Majesty's Envoy, that his Excellency has been
compelled, by the refusal of his just demands,
and by a systematic course of disrespect adopted
towards him by the Persian Government, to
quit the court of the Schah, and to make a public
declaration of the cessation of all intercourse
between the two Governments. The necessity
under which Great Britain is placed of regarding
the present advance of the Persian arms
into Affghanistan as an act of hostility towards
herself, has also been officially communicated
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
to the Schah, under the express order of Her
Majesty's Government.</p>

<p>"The chiefs of Candahar (brothers of Dost
Mahomed Khan, of Cabul) have avowed their
adherence to the Persian policy, with the same
full knowledge of its opposition to the rights
and interests of the British nation in India,
and to have been openly assisting in the
operations against Herat.</p>

<p>"In the crisis of affairs consequent upon the
retirement of our Envoy from Cabul, the
Governor-General felt the importance of taking
immediate measures for arresting the rapid
progress of foreign intrigue and aggression
towards our own territories.</p>

<p>"His attention was naturally drawn, at this
conjuncture, to the position and claims of Schah
Sooja-ool-Moolk, a monarch who, when in
power, had cordially acceded to the measures
of united resistance to external enmity which
were, at that time judged necessary by the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
British Government, and who, on his empire
being usurped by its present rulers, had found
an honourable asylum in the British dominions.</p>

<p>"It had clearly been ascertained, from the
information furnished by the various officers
who have visited Afghanistan, that the Barukzye
chiefs, from their disunion and unpopularity,
were ill-fitted, under any circumstances,
to be useful allies to the British Government,
and to aid us in our just and necessary measures
of national defence. Yet so long as they
refrained from proceedings injurious to our
interests and security, the British Government
acknowledged and respected their authority.
But a different policy appeared to be now more
than justified by the conduct of those chiefs,
and to be indispensable to our own safety.
The welfare of our possessions in the East
requires that we should have on our western
frontier an ally who is interested in resisting
aggression and establishing tranquillity, in the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
place of chiefs ranging themselves in subservience
to a hostile Power, and seeking to
promote schemes of conquest and aggrandisement.</p>

<p>"After a serious and mature deliberation,
the Governor-General was satisfied that pressing
necessity, as well as every consideration of
policy and justice, warranted us in espousing
the cause of Schah Sooja-ool-Moolk, whose
popularity throughout Affghanistan had been
proved to his Lordship by the strong and
unanimous testimony of the best authorities.
Having arrived at this determination, The
Governor-General was further of opinion that
it was just and proper, no less from the position
of Maharaja Runjeet Singh, than from his
undeviating friendship towards the British
Government, that his Highness should have the
offer of becoming a party to the contemplated
operations. Mr. Macnaghten was accordingly
deputed in June last to the Court of his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
Highness, and the result of his mission has
been the conclusion of a tripartite treaty by
the British Government, the Maharaja, and
Schah Sooja-ool-Moolk, whereby his Highness
is guaranteed in his present possessions, and has
bound himself to co-operate for the restoration
of the Schah to the throne of his ancestors.
The friends and enemies of any one of the contracting
parties have been declared to be the
friends and enemies of all. Various points
have been adjusted which had been the subject
of discussion between the British Government
and his Highness the Maharaja, the identity
of whose interests with those of the hon.
Company has now been made apparent to all the
surrounding States. A guaranteed independence
will, upon favourable conditions, be
tendered to the Ameers of Scinde; and the
integrity of Herat, in the possession of its
present ruler, will be fully respected; whilst, by
the measures completed or in progress it may
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
reasonably be hoped that the general freedom
and security of commerce will be promoted;
that the name and just influence of the British
Government will gain their proper footing
among the nations of central Asia; that
tranquillity will be established upon the most
important frontier in India, and that a lasting
barrier will be raised against hostile intrigue and
encroachment.</p>

<p>"His Majesty Schah Sooja-ool-Moolk will
enter Affghanistan surrounded by his own
troops, and will be supported against foreign
interference and factious opposition by a British
army. The Governor-General confidently hopes
that the Schah will be speedily replaced on
his throne by his own subjects and adherents;
and when once he shall be secured in power,
and the independence and integrity of Affghanistan
established, the British army will be
withdrawn.</p>

<p>"The Governor-General has been led to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
these measures by the duty which is imposed
upon him of providing for the security of the
British Crown; but he rejoices that in the
discharge of his duty he will be enabled to
assist in restoring the union and prosperity of
the Affghan people. Throughout the approaching
operations British influence will be sedulously
employed to further every measure of
general benefit, to reconcile differences, to
secure oblivion of injuries, and to put an end
to the distractions by which, for so many years,
the welfare and happiness of the Affghans
have been impaired.</p>

<p>"Even to the chiefs whose hostile proceedings
have given just cause of offence to the
British Government, it will seek to secure
liberal and honourable treatment, on their tendering
early submission, and ceasing from opposition
to that course of measures which may
be judged the most suitable for the general
advantage of their country.
